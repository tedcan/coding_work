  CS264 Final Project
-------------------------

The "tr8_mpi.zip" contains the code for parsing news links.
It is self contained and it can be used for actual testing.

The "meaning-functions-*.zip" file is the process of obtaining the dictionary
of word-meaning values we obtained. It can be run in order to replicate our own results.

Both archives have individual README files.
