                               even as the euro zone hurtles towards a crash  most people are assuming that  in the end  european leaders will do whatever it takes to save the single currency  that is because the consequences of the euro’s destruction are so catastrophic that no sensible policymaker could stand by and let it happen a euro break up would cause a global bust worse even than the one in      the world’s most financially integrated region would be ripped apart by defaults  bank failures and the imposition of capital controls  see  article    the euro zone could shatter into different pieces  or a large block in the north and a fragmented south  amid the recriminations and broken treaties after the failure of the european union’s biggest economic project  wild currency swings between those in the core and those in the periphery would almost certainly bring the single market to a shuddering halt  the survival of the eu itself would be in doubt yet the threat of a disaster does not always stop it from happening  the chances of the euro zone being       
                               it was not a very ambitious target  all that the congressional “supercommittee” was required to do was to figure out a list of measures that would reduce america’s budget deficits by      trillion over the next ten years  that sounds a lot  until you realise it is only      of gdp  not even a quarter of the    trillion or so that is really needed to right the books in washington  and less than    of the    trillion that the federal government is expected to spend over that period  to reach a goal that a business cost cutter would regard as desultory  the bipartisan committee of   senators and congressmen was accorded exceptional powers  its work was to be subject to a simple up or down vote  with no possibility of amendment  and the senate would not be able to use its power to filibuster  yet on november  st  after three months of deliberation  the team was forced to admit that it had failed on paper this failure might not seem to matter very much  supposedly  spending cuts equivalent to the same      trillion figure will now automatically be triggered  starting in    with    billion hacked out of       
                               in the past fortnight  bashar assad’s regime has become both lonelier and bloodier  as the isolation of the president and his country have become more stark  you would think that he would become keener to negotiate his way out of his murderous impasse  yet he seems to be doing the precise opposite  after the arab league’s offer to mediate  his security forces have sharply increased their rate of killing  rather than engage seriously with the democratic opposition  mr assad seems ever more determined to crush it  as a result  the league took the dramatic step  on november  th  of suspending syria from membership  unless mr assad changes course  he risks ending up like muammar qaddafi in libya  yet even at this late hour it is still worth trying to make him see sense  see  article   as peaceful protests against mr assad’s regime gathered steam  he had reckoned that syria’s pivotal place in the arab world would dissuade his fellow arabs  as well as turks and persians  from turning against him  instead the pace at which he is running

                               with thunderclouds looming over the trans atlantic economy  it was easy to miss a bright piece of news last weekend from the other crucible of world trade  the pacific rim  in honolulu  where barack obama hosted a summit of asia pacific leaders  canada  japan and mexico expressed interest in joining nine countries  america  australia  brunei  chile  malaysia  new zealand  peru  singapore and vietnam  in discussing a free trade pact  altogether  the possible members of the trans pacific partnership  tpp  produce    of world gdp—far more than the european union regional trade deals are not always a good idea  if they distract policymakers from global trade liberalisation  they are to be discouraged  but with the doha round of global trade talks showing no flicker of life  there is little danger that the tpp will derail a broader agreement  and by cutting barriers  strengthening intellectual property protections and going beyond a web of existing trade deals  it should boost world trade the creation of a wider tpp is still some way off  for it to come into being its architects—mr obama  who faces a tough

                               although it came after scandal  scheming and a truly dismal record as prime minister  silvio berlusconi’s resignation pledge was no more cathartic than any other of the remedies that the euro zone has so far concocted  the gesture was too little because mr berlusconi is so distrusted  after a total of eight and a half disastrous years in charge  that even now some fear he will find a way to hang on to office or stand again  it was too late because  by the time he promised to resign  italy’s bonds were consumed by panic  at one point yields gapped up towards     —a level that would eventually pitch italy into insolvency and long before that triggers a run on its banks when the world’s third largest bond market begins to buckle  catastrophe looms  at stake is not just the italian economy but spain  portugal  ireland  the euro  the european union’s single market  the global banking system  the world economy  and pretty much anything else you can think of  greece is important because it sets precedents for the euro—over such things as debt write downs and rescues  see       
                               given that flying people around the world is the ultimate globalised industry  there is oddly little competition in the airlines business  passengers who are prepared to change planes once or twice to get to their destinations have lots of choice  but on transatlantic routes between hubs there are often only one or two carriers to choose from this lack of competition is partly the result of collusion sanctioned by regulators  on transatlantic routes members within each of the world’s three big alliances—star  oneworld and skyteam—share costs and agree on prices  they are spreading their tentacles around the world  see  article    the expected purchase by ba  a oneworld member  of a smaller rival  bmi  from lufthansa  a star member   may boost oneworld’s position by adding bmi’s heathrow slots to oneworld’s already dominant position in transatlantic flights america’s department of transportation  dot   which has some antitrust powers  has not only given its blessing to the rise of alliances  but actually requires airlines to       
                               congress guards its privileges jealously  so when it agrees to delegate much of its power  even temporarily  the moment should not be squandered  that is why so much depends on its joint select committee  a group of six democrats and six republicans drawn equally from the house of representatives and the senate  which has been charged with hacking away at america’s swollen deficit by november  rd  this “supercommittee” is supposed to come up with a plan to save at least      trillion     trillion over the next ten years  exceptionally  any plan it agrees on will not be subject to amendment  only to a straight up or down vote  and it will need only a simple majority in the senate  not the usual   votes out of    and as a final incentive  if the package fails to get through  harsher and more immediate cuts will automatically be imposed  in ways that politicians of both stripes would hate  in short  if there was ever an incentive for barack obama’s party and its republican opponents to do what they should have done a long time ago  it is this few outsiders know what is going on inside the supercommittee        
                               manchester’s town hall is a victorian neo gothic temple to local government  packed with murals commemorating episodes from the city’s history  as the capital of britain’s long gone cotton trade  the city is particularly well endowed with  th century civic grandeur  but all over the country  the juxtaposition of the splendour of the old buildings with the impotence of modern councils speaks eloquently of the decline of local government in britain now the conservative liberal democrat government wants to shift power to locally elected mayors  the aim is a worthy one  and the only thing wrong with the plans is that they do not go nearly far enough for more than a century governments have sucked power away from britain’s cities  these days most mayors have little more than a gold chain to show for their offices  and local government is kept on a short financial leash by whitehall  which provides most of the money that it spends  thus undermining its power and its responsibility the previous labour government went some way towards reversing that trend by encouraging a few cities  including london  to vote for mayors

                               misdiagnosis is not  in itself  malpractice  everyone  be they doctors or central bankers or politicians  makes mistakes  but when the misdiagnosis involves ignoring some symptoms and persisting in treatments that aren’t working  it is not so easily excused  and that is what is going on with the euro  where a stress on demanding austerity has eclipsed the need to boost confidence germany  the european central bank  ecb  and many others diagnose today’s mess as stemming primarily from profligacy on the periphery  “it is an indisputable fact”  wolfgang schäuble  germany’s finance minister  recently wrote in the  financial times   that “excessive state spending has led to unsustainable levels of debt and deficits that now threaten our economic welfare ”if profligacy is the problem  the argument goes  austerity is the solution  with public thrift serving to rebuild investor confidence  the leaders of the euro’s core countries have demanded draconian budget cuts as the price of rescue loans to troubled economies  they have pressed the italian and spanish governments to tighten more and faster        
                               the costs of efforts to save the euro are justified by the claim that the alternative would be too dreadful to contemplate  but economic history is littered with examples of fixed exchange rates that came unfixed  the disuniting of currency unions  though rarer  happens from time to time  so how do the costs of sustaining the euro compare with the costs of its falling apart the question does not have a simple answer  for a start  there are lots of different ways to fall apart  a wholesale dissolution into the original currencies  a fissioning into northern hard currency and southern soft currency blocks  or the exit of a trickle of countries  or just one  further complexities come from the panoply of choices the departing and remaining states would make after the fall  and all this turns as much or more on law and politics as on economics take two specific scenarios  germany could leave  either on its own or with a select group of small economies—austria  finland and the netherlands—as recently suggested by hans olaf henkel  a former head of the federation of german industries  second  and more likely

                               prepare for some bad news  the prime minister  david cameron  told an audience of business leaders on november  st that shrinking the budget deficit was “proving harder than anyone envisaged ” his comments laid the ground for the chancellor  george osborne  who makes his autumn statement on the economy and public finances on november  th  the chancellor’s message is likely to be grim  a downgrade to official growth forecasts for next year and beyond seems certain  the coalition government’s hopes of eliminating the “structural” part of the deficit  the bit that cannot be blamed on temporary slack in the economy  and of capping public debt by the end of the current parliament are in serious doubt bond markets are likely to be forgiving  given the scale of troubles elsewhere  but a failure to hit its fiscal targets would harm the coalition government’s credibility  and there is a more pressing worry  britain’s strong links with the wretched euro zone mean that its economy is being dragged into continent wide recession  see  article        
                               if david cameron is loathed by voters but grudgingly credited with economic competence  can he win the next general election  a few months ago the question would have sounded bizarre  mr cameron secured the conservative leadership in   with a pledge to decontaminate the party’s brand  rescuing the “nasty party” was mr cameron’s mission  and he pursued it with well bred cheer  whether being pulled by huskies across an arctic glacier to show concern over climate change  talking of his devotion to the national health service or making the conservative case for gay marriage with britain seemingly headed back into recession  the prime minister finds himself at a turning point  close allies  conservative mps and sympathetic think tanks advise him that the quest for economic growth must trump all other considerations  wish lists are pouring in from all sides  with a bias towards supply side reforms aimed at making britain a lightly taxed  flexibly regulated and competitive place to do business  all point to the same conclusion  that mr cameron might have to retoxify the tory brand to save the economy suggestions

    consider the priorities of the leaders of big american financial institutions in the aftermath of the financial crisis  they must cope with a deluge of murky new rules  respond to reams of litigation  reorganise mind boggling capital structures  pacify anti banker mobs  and anti banker reporters   and cut compensation while artfully preserving their own perks put simply  says the head of one vast and troubled financial institution  risk must be reduced  liquidity increased and costs controlled  missing from the list  providing credit for borrowers one of the many vacuums this emphasis has produced is for middle market lending—a statistically murky category whose rough definition could be credit for companies small enough to lack access to public markets but big enough to require vastly more funding than informal channels such as friends and family could provide not long ago this was prime territory for banks  it has not been entirely abandoned  ge capital  cit  suntrust  wells fargo  us bank and bank of america are significant participants  but thousands of smaller banks  once a mainstay of this market  are no longer in business  others have merged and lend less to midsized firms than their constituent parts once did among the reasons for this withdrawal are the managerial challenges of analysing the creditworthiness of small companies with none of the crutches that come       
                               when mario draghi took over as president of the european central bank at the beginning of this month  it was felt that he had to prove his credentials in germany  that task is made harder by calls on the ecb to act as backstop to troubled italy  mr draghi’s home country  and to contain a sovereign debt crisis that is raising borrowing costs for most euro zone countries  while driving them down in germany this week jens weidmann  the head of the bundesbank  germany’s central bank  raised the bond market pressure on italy and on mr draghi by saying that central bank support for government finances would be illegal  mr weidmann told the  financial times  that the ecb could not act as a lender of last resort for countries  because in doing so it would transgress eu treaties banning direct financing of states  it would be counter productive as well  argued mr weidmann  the roots of the euro zone crisis lay with governments  and providing them with cheap financing would only reduce pressure for reform with bond markets so febrile  mr weidmann’s comments were ill timed  yet his views were scarcely       
                               angela merkel  the german chancellor  spoke for many europeans when she said last year that “we must re establish the primacy of politics over the markets ” the europeans created the euro to prevent the crises caused by currency speculators  only to find themselves pushed around by bond investors politicians have often cursed the markets  harold wilson  a british prime minister  used to fulminate against the “gnomes of zurich” who speculated against the pound  in the mythology of the british labour party  a “bankers’ ramp” pushed the party out of office in    james carville  a political adviser to bill clinton  wanted to be reincarnated as the bond market so he could “intimidate everybody” in theory  there is an easy answer  if you don’t want to be bothered about the bond markets  don’t borrow from them  the finance ministers of norway and saudi arabia have no cause to worry about their borrowing costs because they are net creditors not all nations can be creditors  of course  but john maynard keynes’s plans for the post   monetary system were aimed at limiting the imbalances that arose in the

    economists are constantly urging governments to adopt policies that would reduce global imbalances—which  in crude terms  means that china should slash its current account surplus and america its deficit  yet they ignore the biggest imbalance of all  the current account surplus that planet earth appears to run with extraterrestrials  in theory  countries’ current account balances should all sum to zero because one country’s export is another’s import  however  if you add up all countries’ reported current account transactions  exports minus imports of goods and services  net investment income  workers’ remittances and other transfers   the world exported    billion more than it imported in    according to the imf’s world economic outlook  the fund forecasts that the global current account surplus will rise to almost    billion by   are aliens buying louis vuitton handbags  are little green men bagging the best sunbeds by the hotel pool  the more down to earth explanation is that the global surplus reflects statistical errors  either the current account deficits of countries such as america are being understated or the surpluses of countries like china are being overstated  and by a rising amount

                               in asia kingdoms are said to rise and fall with the shifting price of rice  so the continent’s rulers presumably ought to be worried by the effects of disastrous floods in thailand  the world’s biggest exporter of the white grains  see chart  last year thailand provided about a third by volume of all internationally traded rice—around  m tonnes  thailand’s government reckons that some  m  m tonnes  nearly a fifth of the country’s total production  might have been destroyed by the deluge  some analysts say that the damage could be even more severe  pessimists worry that thailand’s exports could be cut by  m  m tonnes  with the world trade in rice expected to hit over  m tonnes in   this could take around    out of the market  if the same thing happened with oil or wheat the results would be calamitous but the nature of the rice market means that the consequences may not be as severe  rice is a resilient crop  and the floods may not do as much damage as some fear  although rice is a staple for half the world’s population  international trade is small compared with the  m tonnes that will pop out of       
                     an unkind cut             childhood anaemia is a problem  around the world  almost a quarter of under fives suffer from it  and anaemia is not a trivial thing  a child’s development  both physical and mental  is stifled by a lack of iron  the reason is that  besides its well known role in haemoglobin  the oxygen transporting molecule in the blood  iron is also involved in many aspects of brain development a study just published in the  british medical journal  by ola andersson  an obstetrician at the hospital of halland in halmstad  sweden  suggests that a simple change of medical procedure when a child is born may bring a big reduction in anaemia  that change is not to cut the umbilical cord linking the child with the placenta straight after birth—as is standard practice—but  rather  to give it time to transfer more of the placenta’s contents  particularly its blood  to the child it has been nurturing the argument in favour of rapid clamping is that too much blood may flow from the detached placenta to the newly born child  and that this can cause problems of its

    something odd is going on in the international aids establishment  december  st has been designated  as it is every year  to be “world aids day”  that is a signal for the united nations to put out a report on the state of the epidemic  this year  though  there are to be two reports on november  st unaids  an agency created in   to deal specifically with the then newish disease  published its assessment of the situation  this reaffirmed what has become clear recently  that the epidemic is being beaten back by the widespread deployment of drugs  in combination with changes in the behaviour of those most at risk  the annual number of deaths has fallen to    m  from its peak of    m in    new infections have also fallen  from a peak of    m in   to    m last year  the report went on to outline what it calls an investment framework  designed to deal with the epidemic in the most cost effective way  this builds on an analysis published in the  lancet  in june by bernhard schwartländer  unaids’s director of evidence  strategy and results  it attempts to prescribe  for each part of the world  the mixture of drug treatment  condom promotion  prophylactic circumcision and so on that will bring most benefit to the fight on november  th  however  a joint report by the world health organisation  who   the united nations’ children’s fund  unicef  and—you’       
    climate science is famously complicated  but one useful number to keep in mind is “climate sensitivity”  this measures the amount of warming that can eventually be expected to follow a doubling in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  in its most recent summary of the science behind its predictions  published in    estimated that  in present conditions  a doubling of co  would cause warming of about  °c  with uncertainty of about a degree and a half in either direction  but it also says there is a small probability that the true number is much higher  some recent studies have suggested that it could be as high as  °c if that were true  disaster beckons  but a paper published in this week’s  science   by andreas schmittner of oregon state university  suggests it is not  in dr schmittner’s analysis  the climate is less sensitive to carbon dioxide than was feared existing studies of climate sensitivity mostly rely on data gathered from weather stations  which go back to roughly    dr schmittner takes a different approach  his data come from the peak of the most recent ice age  between     and     years ago  his group is not the first to use such data  ice cores  fossils  marine sediments and the like  to probe the climate’s sensitivity to carbon dioxide  but their paper is the most

    how people collaborate  in the face of numerous temptations to cheat  is an important field of psychological and economic research  a lot of this research focuses on the “tit for tat” theory of co operation  that humans are disposed  when dealing with another person  to behave in a generous manner until that other person shows himself not to be generous  at this point co operation is withdrawn  fool me once  in other words  shame on you  fool me twice  shame on me when he encounters such a withdrawal of collaboration  the theory goes  the malefactor will learn the error of his ways and become a more co operative individual  and there is experimental evidence  based on specially designed games  that tit for tat does work for pairs of people  human societies  though  are more complex than mere dyads  and until recently  it has been difficult to model that complexity in the laboratory  but a paper published this week in the  proceedings of the national academy of sciences  by nicholas christakis and his colleagues at harvard has changed that  dr christakis arranged for a collaboration testing game to be played over the web  with many participants  as a result  he and his team have gained a more sophisticated insight into the way co operation develops dr christakis used what is known as a public goods game for his experiment  at the beginning of such a

                               one answer to the question  “what ate dinosaurs ” is  obviously  “other dinosaurs ” theropod predators like  tyrannosaurus  and  allosaurus  loom large in the imagination of every lover of prehistoric monsters  and their animatronic fights with the likes of  diplodocus  and  stegosauru s are the stuff of cliché  science  though  tries to look beyond the obvious  and at this year’s meeting of the society of vertebrate palaeontology  held in las vegas  some of the speakers asked whether the top predators of the mesozoic era really were all dinosaurs  their conclusion was “no”  another group of reptiles  until recently neglected  were also important carnivores  and it is a group that is still around today  the crocodiles that the past role of crocodiles  or  strictly  crocodilians  since they came in many sizes and shapes  not all of which resemble the modern animals  has been underestimated was suggested a few years ago by paul sereno  dr sereno  a palaeontologist at the university of chicago  uncovered a crocodile dominated

   this post has been updated the bad news out of europe is coming fast and thick now  markets were still digesting news of spain s terrible bond auction yesterday  in which the yield on its   month debt more than doubled  from      to over     that was but an appetizer  however  in an auction of   year debt today  germany failed to place some    of the issuance  the lack of appetite for german debt has come as a shock to many  and the language being used to describe matters is increasingly apocalyptic   it is a complete and utter disaster   reuters has one strategist saying  on the secondary market  german bond yields have finally joined those of its neighbours on their upward march  the german   year yield is up sharply today  update  this initially read that the   year yield was up   percentage points on the day  in fact it was up      and back above     it still has a way to go to catch france and austria  approaching      belgium  over      and spain and italy  back near     trouble at big european banks is growing  the euro zone banking system is increasingly reliant on the european central bank for funding  the prospect of bank failures is a troubling one given the fiscal strain on european sovereigns  no one wants to find itself in ireland s position  squarely in bond vigilantes  crosshairs having assumed the obligations of sinking banks  uncontrolled       
   one can almost hear the gates clanging  one after the other the sources of funding for europe’s banks are being shut  it is a result of the highly visible run on europe’s government bond markets  which today reached the heart of the euro zone  an auction of new german bonds failed to generate enough demand for the full amount  causing a drop in bond prices  and prompting the bundesbank to buy    of the bonds offered  according to reuters  now another run—more hidden  but potentially more dangerous—is taking place  on the continents’ banks  people are not yet queuing up in front of bank branches  except in latvia’s capital riga where savers today were trying to withdraw money from krajbanka  a mid sized bank  pictured   but billions of euros are flooding out of europe’s banking system through bond and money markets at best  the result may be a credit crunch that leaves businesses unable to get loans and invest  at worst  some banks may fail—and trigger real bank runs in countries whose shaky public finances have left them ill equipped to prop up their financial institutions to make loans  banks need funding  for this  they mainly tap into three sources  long term bonds  deposits from consumers  and short term loans from money markets as well as other banks  bond issues and short term funding have been seizing up as the panic over government bonds has spread to banks  which       
   another monday  and the crisis in europe continues to build  euro zone governments continue to tumble  spain forcefully ejected its socialist government on sunday  its recent rule coincided with economic collapse  rising unemployment  and round after round of austerity  as the government sought to get ahead of the debt crisis  the new government s large majority will give it more room to manage an unmanageable crisis  spanish yields are rising today  along with those of italy  the crisis is beyond the power of individual governments to solve on their own  coordination is key which makes one piece of news out of brussels today seem at least somewhat auspicious  the european commission has put together a white paper  to be released this week  proposing the creation of euro bonds  it appears that three different options are discussed  moving along the spectrum of shared risk  in those least ambitious version  the combined governments of the euro zone would provide some guarantee for the newly issued bonds of national governments  in the most ambitious scheme  the euro zone would approve individual budgets  which would be financed through euro bonds  the paper is best understood as just another step forward in the long process of tighter fiscal integration within the euro zone  the problem  of course  is that europe wouldn t appear to have that much time to put together       
   george osborne  britain s finance minister  has been criticised for trying to pull the country out of its budgetary hole too quickly  is he also dumping the state s banking interests with undue haste  on november  th the government announced it was selling northern rock  a mortgage bank nationalised in february    for an initial cash payment of £ m  the buyer is virgin money  part of the private conglomerate run by richard branson  a publicity hungry businessman the sale price is below the £    billion the state had put into the bank to keep it solvent  and opposition politicians  plus a few in mr osborne s own party  have questioned the timing of the sale  when the value of bank shares across europe are depressed  but the deal looks a reasonable one for the british taxpayer  hanging on to the bank until stockmarkets picked up might have sharply diminished its remaining franchise value  what is more  the government added a few sweeteners for itself  virgin has committed not to lay off staff for three years and to keep the bank s headquarters in newcastle  a city short of private sector employers  in addition to the upfront £ m  a further cash payment of £ m is due within   months of the deal completing  the state will also receive a £ m       
   so “the bearded one”  as some in business and the media refer to sir richard branson  is becoming a high street banker in britain  following today’s announcement that virgin money will acquire the state owned northern rock for £ m       billion   cassandra must declare an interest  some of my modest savings are in northern rock  which was taken over by the government in   after the financial crisis sparked a run on the bank  should northern rock’s depositors feel nervous that they no longer benefit from the absolute safety of state ownership—or should they congratulate sir richard  whose first bid for the bank was turned down in     the irony  of course  is that virgin is taking over northern rock just as the euro zone crisis is threatening to provoke another global banking near meltdown  still  my preference is to be optimistic  northern rock’s dodgy assets have been hived off into a “bad bank” that remains in the government’s hands and virgin’s northern rock  though a relative minnow in the banking sea  will bring some added competition in   to britain’s oligopolistic retail banking sector  full business will apparently start in     what really gladdens the heart  though  is the simple fact that sir richard will bring plenty of colour  flair and even glamour to the world of banking  whether that will be enough to lessen the public’s present loathing of

   during the financial crisis of    it became abundantly clear that america s banking system was not equipped to handle the failure of a large  systemically important financial institution  the bankruptcy of lehman brothers nearly brought down the global financial system  the government s response  however—to bail out large banks lest they destroy the broader economy—wasn t particularly satisfactory  it created substantial moral hazard problems and brought risks of its own  including taxpayer exposure to large bank losses and corruption concerns after the dust settled  congress set to work devising new banking rules designed to ensure that in the future too big to fail banks could be allowed to fail  the resulting law has come to be known as dodd frank  and one day  perhaps sooner than we d prefer  the machinery of dodd frank will be put to the test to demonstrate how that might work  the economist convened an all star cast—including larry summers as treasury secretary and donald kohn as head of the federal reserve—to participate in a simulation of a banking crisis  held at last week s buttonwood gathering in new york  a hypothetical large bank is on the brink of failure  and the invited experts are tasked with playing out the crisis  resolution within the constraints of the new regulatory framework  the simulation makes for fascinating  and instructive        
   “bank error in your favour—collect £ ” is a welcome windfall familiar to players of monopoly  but german finance ministry officials were not so pleased  on october  th  to have to own up to an accounting mistake that had overstated the national debt by €    billion this small rounding error was discovered at fms wertmanagement  a government owned “bad bank” set up in july    its assets  which include multiple toxic derivatives  were spun out of hypo real estate  hre   a lender that was rescued in october   and fully nationalised in june    apparently  the balance sheet had been reckoned to total €    billion instead of €    billion  assets held as collateral to offset derivatives positions had been added rather than subtracted  “we saw that it makes no sense to swell the balance sheet in this way ” explains an fms spokesman the find will have no effect on the federal budget  because the bad bank clean up comes out of a special contingency budget  but there is an effect on germany’s overall indebtedness  which now drops from      to      of gdp who is to blame  opposition politicians are calling for wolfgang schäuble  germany s christian democrat finance minister  to take responsibility since it happened on his watch  but that is a little unfair  one should surely be allowed to put one’s trust in bean counters at hre and fms  or at pricewaterhousecoopers        
   the   election cycle is likely to feature plenty of inveighing against government underwriting of  too big to fail  financial institutions  from the left  the rhetoric will concentrate on the big bad financial industry  which demands that government bail it out or the economy gets it  from the right  it will concentrate on big bad government  which demands that the financial industry take its money in order to consolidate socialist control over the economy  or something  i ve never entirely understood how that argument runs in any case  one line of argument the election cycle won t feature is candidates for senator from nebraska  say  arguing that nebraska taxpayers have no business bailing out new york banks  or candidates for senator from massachusetts  say  arguing that massachusetts taxpayers have no business bailing out georgia banks  that kind of argument  however  is now preventing the german political system from assembling the necessary political capital to save the euro  reports quentin peel one of the best speakers in the bundestag is gregor gysi  leader of the far left linke party  and he never misses an opportunity to taunt his more worthy rivals in big debates with embarrassing insights ‘why don’t you tell the german taxpayers the truth ’ he demanded of ms merkel  ‘they are being asked to pay for the losses of the french banks’  the chancellor looked pained       
   andrew haldane  the executive director for financial stability of the bank of england  has given many excellent speeches but his latest effort is a must read for anyone who wants to know how we got into this current financial mess   the speech deals with  the flaw  that so confounded alan greenspan  how private sector investors failed to control risks in the banking sector  the problem was not that bank executives had no skin in the game  in    the managers with the largest bank stakes were dick fuld of lehman brothers  jimmy cayne at bear stearns  stan o neal at merrill lynch  john mack at morgan stanley and angelo mozilo at countywide  all lost substantial chunks of their wealth as share prices collapsed   the fundamental problem is that tax rules  the deductibility of interest  and regulations encouraged banks to gear up their balance sheets  effective control of the banks  however  rested with the shareholders  as haldane puts it    ownership and control rights are vested in agents comprising less than    of the balance sheet   thanks to limited liability  the losses of these shareholders are also constrained  in the early  th century  liability was unlimited  prompting banks to run with much more conservative balance sheets  but that was deemed to deprive industry of much needed capital so limited liability was brought in   that transferred the responsibility for       
   it’s not a bank problem  it’s a sovereign debt problem  a chorus of european bankers have protested in the past few days  among them  josef ackermann  chief executive of deutsche bank  insisted on october  th that recapitalising the banks would not address the real issue  which is the fact that government bonds have lost their status as risk free assets mr ackermann has a point  where else can banks keep their spare liquidity when not in government bonds  which used to be regarded by regulators and bank risk managers alike as risk free assets  that meant that a large chunk of assets on bank balance sheets were counted against capital as zero risk  not any more simply talking about recapitalisation is counter productive  mr ackermann told a gathering in berlin  because it sends signals that a haircut on sovereign debt  which will further add to the risk burden on bank capital  is ever more likely these fine arguments did not do his bank much good  within hours fitch  a rating agency  had put deutsche bank on rating watch negative  part of fitch’s argument was that deutsche might have difficulty reaching its target capitalisation under regulations known as basel    that suggests it would have even more difficulty meeting targets sooner if the european banking authority suddenly recommends  as is being considered  an across the board core tier   capital target of between

   it was only a matter of time before china was heralded as europe’s escape route from its debt crisis  news that nicolas sarkozy  the french president  called hu jintao  his opposite number in china  after the crisis summit on october  th sparked speculation that china might put substantial amounts of money into the debt of troubled euro zone borrowers  the chatter grew louder when klaus regling  the head of the european financial stability facility  efsf   the euro area’s bail out fund  visited beijing a day later  and a poor post summit italian bond auction has made the need for a deus ex machina seem even greater china certainly has lots of money to invest  its foreign exchange reserves are reckoned at      trillion  it trades more with the eu than any other partner  it has exposure to the euro already  how much is not known  but currency analysts suspect that about a quarter of those reserves are already euro denominated  giving it an incentive to keep the currency strong  it also suits china to play the part of a constructive economic actor    
   reading american coverage of china s currency policy  one is often left with the impression that the chinese government isn t allowing the yuan to rise faster because it doesn t realise the harm it s doing to its own economy  or because its simply too greedy to give up its competitive edge in trade  in reality  china is facing very difficult choices and is struggling to undo its previous decisions without destabilising the world s second largest economy  here  via menzie chinn  is chinese macroeconomist yu yongding  apologies for long  but i think appropriate  block quoting it is clear that china should have brought to an end to the endless piling up of  foreign exchange reserves long time ago  there have been two basic  approaches for achieving this objective  the first approach is to reduce current  account surplus indirectly via narrowing the saving investment gap  the  second one is to reduce current account surplus directly by dismantling trade  promotion policy  such as abolishing tax rebate and allowing renminbi to  appreciate  china has tried the two approaches at the same time with a very  cautious fashion  to reduce the saving gap by lowering the saving rate could  be an ideal solution  unfortunately  due to various reasons  to achieve the  balance between saving and investment may take long time  by the time when  the chinese economy has been rebalanced  no one

   china s economy grew at a      annual pace in the third quarter of this year  that s down a touch from the      rate notched in the second quarter  and it s a bit below expectations for      growth  markets didn t much care for the news  but      is a pretty healthy clip given the weakness spreading across most of the world economy  industrial production grew somewhat faster than expected  a nice surprise given pmi numbers that have shown china s manufacturing sector contracting slightly for much of the quarter  generally  speaking  the hoped for soft landing seems to be on track at ft alphaville  however  kate mackenzie collects comments on the report that provide reason for pessimism  in particular  china s exports have been falling rapidly in recent months  and especially sales to europe  that may throw a wrench in china s plans to rebalance its economy  amid strong export demand  it would be easier for china to relax the rules that artificially constrain consumption  given a broad slowdown in key export markets  however  china may be reluctant to give up any of the edges that its manufacturers enjoy michael pettis has written that japan s growth slowdown didn t generate the public outcry one might have expected because beneath the headline figures the japanese economy was rebalancing itself toward greater reliance on consumption  as a result  japanese consumers felt as

   the yuan dollar exchange rate and america s trade deficit with china  on october  th the senate is due to vote on a bill that would lead to sanctions being taken against countries whose currencies are  misaligned   one currency in particular—the yuan—is on the minds of legislators   but as the chart below suggests  the recent relationship between china s currency and america s trade deficit with china is not what china hawks in the senate think it is  rather than a cheap yuan leading to a flood of chinese imports  the yuan has actually strengthened as the deficit has widened  there are many things american companies dislike about the way business is done in china  intellectual property theft  the impossibility of winning government contracts  baffling rules on corporate ownership and so on  however the place for fixing these things is the world trade organisation  not congress  president obama s administration has already passed on two opportunities to label china a currency manipulator  out of a well founded fear of sparking a trade war  senators should do the same  while hoping that china responds to their sabre rattling by letting the yuan rise a little more  as happened the last time the senate came close to passing a similar measure  in       
   once again  america s congress is considering punitive action against china over its currency policy  and once again a debate is raging over whether this is a good idea  paul krugman is leading the charge yet again  and he s preemptively responding to a number of arguments against action on china—but not mine the issue is not whether a floating yuan would be  on balance  good for america  it would  the dollar would probably weaken against the yuan  which would probably result in a reduction in america s multilateral trade balance  this isn t guaranteed  of course  the dollar has been rising against the euro and many emerging market currencies of late  mostly thanks to broader financial fear  the resulting shifts could offset depreciation against the yuan  and that s assuming that a china with fewer restriction on capital movements wouldn t be subject to the same capital outflows as other emerging markets  it does seem likely  however  that the american economy would adjust somewhat more easily given a floating yuan

   i ve been thinking a lot about this michael pettis post from the weekend  in which he offers some economic predictions for the remainder of the decade  what s most interesting about his thinking is the way he orients his model of economic activity around balance of payment dynamics  here s an example since most global consumption comes from the us  europe and japan  the collapse in their demand will ultimately be very painful for the brics and the rest of the developing world  the latter have postponed the impact of contracting consumption by increasing domestic investment  in some cases very sharply  but the purpose of higher current investment is to serve higher future consumption  in many countries  most notably china  the higher investment will itself limit future consumption growth  and so with weak consumption growth in the developed world  and no relief from the developing world  today’s higher investment will actually exacerbate the impact of the current contraction in consumption mr pettis argues that the pivot around which the bric economies  and china especially  swing is reliance on advanced country demand  as that anchor  sorry  mixing metaphors  becomes dislodged  bric economies will face difficult internal structural changes you might not buy all of his predictions  but it s a compelling way to view the big trends in the global economy  and especially the

   i read this piece in hotels magazine with interest  it’s an imagining of how a guest of the future might interact with his hotel during an overnight stay  specifically it looks at how a modern hotel might utilise social media to improve the service it offers customers for example   am pst  you hop on a flight from la to new york  before take off  you tweet  “headed to nyc  looking  ward to drink poolside  thompsonles ” when you land and turn your mobile on  you have a twitter response from  thompsonles  which reads  “we look forward to having you  shall we reserve you a lounge chair ”and later on   pm  when you arrive back in your room  you notice you have a message on your hotel ipad  you open it  and it takes you directly to the hotel s facebook videos  and in particular  a video illustrating the hotel spa s offerings  beneath the video is a “click to reserve spa treatment” button  you do  and before setting the ipad down  you use the hotel s custom app to select and reserve a table at a recommended restaurant it’s all very clever technically  and doubtless responds to some guest needs  but i find this vision leaves me a bit cold  it’s a future where the acme of customer service comes in the shape of rapid response to guest tweets  and where as many interactions as possible between guest and hotel happen seamlessly in cyberspace  heaven forfend that you should actually go       
   amazon s kindle fire was always going to set the tablet world ablaze  even before it starts shipping in november  though  it has managed to reignite the debate over the relative merits of open versus closed software  supporters of openness trumpet it as a way to promote ideas and competition  leading to greater consumer satisfaction and optimal prices  closed systems  goes the argument  remove choice and ramp up prices  if only it were that simple  for a start  the distinction between open and closed is fuzzy  the fire  for example  relies on google s android operating system  not the latest  tablet spec version    but an earlier one designed for smartphones   android is open—in the sense that anyone may view  modify and employ the source code in free or commercial applications without a license  other than that which comes at no cost with the code   modifications to the code may have to be distributed publicly  depending on the specific license in question   android is a melange of code from many open source projects and licensing terms for the ingredients vary   but the touted openness extends only to the code  to display google s trademarked android name  offer the android marketplace for apps  or employ google services  like turn by turn satellite navigation   a device maker must sign separate agreements with google  some in the industry allege that these restrict the

   this post has been updated the bad news out of europe is coming fast and thick now  markets were still digesting news of spain s terrible bond auction yesterday  in which the yield on its   month debt more than doubled  from      to over     that was but an appetizer  however  in an auction of   year debt today  germany failed to place some    of the issuance  the lack of appetite for german debt has come as a shock to many  and the language being used to describe matters is increasingly apocalyptic   it is a complete and utter disaster   reuters has one strategist saying  on the secondary market  german bond yields have finally joined those of its neighbours on their upward march  the german   year yield is up sharply today  update  this initially read that the   year yield was up   percentage points on the day  in fact it was up      and back above     it still has a way to go to catch france and austria  approaching      belgium  over      and spain and italy  back near     trouble at big european banks is growing  the euro zone banking system is increasingly reliant on the european central bank for funding  the prospect of bank failures is a troubling one given the fiscal strain on european sovereigns  no one wants to find itself in ireland s position  squarely in bond vigilantes  crosshairs having assumed the obligations of sinking banks  uncontrolled       
   the short term outlook for the world economy seems to hinge on whether a resolution to europe s debt crisis can be found  a resolution  in turn  will be difficult to come by if the euro zone falls back into recession  if output is shrinking and unemployment rising  then austerity measures are likely to make economic conditions worse while raising very little new revenue  the euro zone is likely to fall ever deeper into a hole that s an unnerving possibility given the outlook for the euro zone economy  growth in the fourth quarter is likely to be contractionary  according to an analysis of recent data points by now casting  which publishes  real time  economic forecasts  you can see the information that goes into their forecast in the interactive chart below  a negative fourth quarter has been a real possibility since july  but as recently as early october the economy appeared to be moderating  since then  the outlook has quickly deteriorated thanks  mostly  to bad news from the core  falling industrial orders in germany is among the most worrisome signs  as are big declines in manufacturing purchasing manager s indexes  particularly a big drop in italy about this chart  the chart shows an evolving prediction—or  now cast —of quarter on quarter gdp growth  now casts are calculated by a statistical model which draws on a wide range of inputs  including both hard and soft       
   things need to get worse before they can get better  that is the view of many commentators on the euro zone crisis  who think that only when complete catastrophe seems imminent  will european political leaders take the necessary action   they don t always agree on what that action might be but it is usually some combination of unlimited bond purchases by the european central bank and moves towards fiscal union  richard mcguire  the fixed income strategist at rabobank  is very much in that camp  he argues that most of the daily headlines  such as changes in greek and italian governments  don t matter  the fundamental problem is one currency and   separate fiscal authorities  until that situation is resolved  there will be no solution  austerity policies won t work but mr mcguire has also figured out what the next stage of the crisis will mean for investors  up until now  the obvious strategy has been to buy german government bonds and sell just about everything else  on the grounds that  if the euro zone does break up  you want your money to be in deutsche marks  but if european politicians do unveil a rescue plan  that will either mean the core countries assuming the burden of eurozone debt  or it will mean that long term inflation risks will have risen at that stage  investors will pile out of long term german government debt and into the short term debt of countries like       
   it has become the worst fear of politicians in america and europe  after the immediate crisis passes  the developed world will settle into a lost decade  or more  of low growth and deflation  just like japan  japan is used as a cautionary tale of ineffective and or inept economic policy  which failed to revive its economy after a bad recession  but as my colleague points out and as an article from our print edition this week suggests  there’s not much more that short term fiscal and monetary policy could have done  a large share of japan’s woes can be blamed on its aging population  in aggregate  japan’s economy grew at half the pace of america’s between   and    yet if judged by growth in gdp per person over the same period  then japan has outperformed america and the euro zone  see chart     in part this is because its population has shrunk whereas america’s population has increased though growth in labour productivity fell slightly short of america’s from   to    total factor productivity  a measure of how a country uses capital and labour  grew faster  according to the tokyo based asian productivity organisation  japan’s unemployment rate is higher than in    yet it remains about half the level of america and europe  anemic japanese growth rates resulted from having fewer young  productive workers  and from the redirection of an increasing share of       
   on november  st hungary formally asked the international monetary fund  imf  for financial support  for the second time in three years  the decision to return to the global lender of last resort appears to signal that the government has abandoned its   month experiment in what it has variously called a “struggle for economic independence”  when addressing certain domestic audiences  or  before a broader public  “unorthodox economic policy”   györgy matolcsy  the finance minister  told parliament that in returning to the imf  the country was seeking a “safety net” utterly unlike the standby loan hungary walked away from last spring  “the situation is completely different ” he said  “because we are starting discussions about a financial safety net from which we don’t want to draw down a single penny ” that suggested he was seeking a loan without too many conditions attached  however  such favourable terms may not be forthcoming  the imf offers loans with few strings attached to countries with sound finances that are in temporary difficulties  but few see hungary’s troubles in such a benign light   at its heart  mr matolcsy’s unorthodox economic policy was a gamble that the government could stimulate domestic and export demand enough to restore economic growth before the resulting deficits caught up with it  when hungary walked away from the imf in spring    it was because       
   another monday  and the crisis in europe continues to build  euro zone governments continue to tumble  spain forcefully ejected its socialist government on sunday  its recent rule coincided with economic collapse  rising unemployment  and round after round of austerity  as the government sought to get ahead of the debt crisis  the new government s large majority will give it more room to manage an unmanageable crisis  spanish yields are rising today  along with those of italy  the crisis is beyond the power of individual governments to solve on their own  coordination is key which makes one piece of news out of brussels today seem at least somewhat auspicious  the european commission has put together a white paper  to be released this week  proposing the creation of euro bonds  it appears that three different options are discussed  moving along the spectrum of shared risk  in those least ambitious version  the combined governments of the euro zone would provide some guarantee for the newly issued bonds of national governments  in the most ambitious scheme  the euro zone would approve individual budgets  which would be financed through euro bonds  the paper is best understood as just another step forward in the long process of tighter fiscal integration within the euro zone  the problem  of course  is that europe wouldn t appear to have that much time to put together       
   another bad day for the markets  investors seem to have taken little heart from the sweeping victory of the popular party in spain  focusing instead on the failure of the us super committee to agree on a deal and rather gloomy statement on the global economy from chinese vice premier wang qishan in the euro zone  investors may be suffering from what lombard street research neatly describes as  crisis solution fatigue   an ft story suggested a plan for eurobonds may be issued this week  last week  the market was pinning its hopes on the ecb and the imf and it was long ago that the european financial stability facility was the rescue vehicle of choice the idea behind eurobonds is to allow the weaker countries to benefit from the financial strength of the likes of germany and the netherlands  after all  at the aggregate level  eurozone government indebtedness is no worse than that of the us  but the quid pro quo for such a deal is some kind of central control over the fiscal policies of euro zone governments as lombard remarkswe remain a long way from any kind of comprehensive solution to europe’s crisis  to start  the most draconian form of eurobond   probably the one that would appeal most to the germans who have to fund it  will face stiff opposition everywhere else  many countries will oppose the loss of sovereignty this scheme seeks to impose on them  sure  there are       
   the theory behind the supercommittee was that it would be a superconducting committee  eliminating the frictions caused by hundreds of clashing representatives in the house and senate and zooming everyone straight along into a      trillion deficit reduction agreement  instead  it seems to have become a supercolliding committee  focusing the two parties down into a narrower space so that the impact blasts everything into tiny subatomic particles the two sides are now close to conceding that the effort has failed  largely due to a fundamental disagreement over the question of whether rich people should pay more in taxes  the republicans  latest full scale plan would ve raised the medicare eligibility age from   to    cut social security benefits  and cut income taxes for all households  under the plan  the top marginal tax rate would fall from    to     according to the new york times  to make up for the tax cuts   republicans would curb      trillion dollars’ worth of tax breaks  items like credits and exemptions for retirement savings  child care and dependents   the plan does not specify which ones would be cut   that last sentence is priceless  meanwhile the republicans made a scaled down last ditch offer on friday that only comes up with    billion in deficit reduction  thus leading to a presumed    billion in  trigger  cuts balanced between defence and       
   in my print column this week i look at the political implications of britain s rising youth unemployment “we are all in this together ” promises david cameron’s government   as it tries to fix shattered public finances and set britain on a path  of sustainable growth  it matters that voters should believe this  not because the claim  will soothe those suffering most from spending cuts or lost employment   instead  a sense of fairness is vital to the broad mass of voters who  keep their jobs in even nasty recessions  and whose households will  survive this crisis  fairness gives the majority permission to support  policies needed to fix the mess  but which will impose real pain on  some that is why it spelled danger for the government when new figures  were released on november  th  showing that youth unemployment had  crossed the one million mark  its highest level in a generation  several  caveats surround that number  youth unemployment has been rising in  britain since before the credit crunch  within the headline total for  jobless    to   year olds  more than a quarter are students looking  for part time work  britain’s youth unemployment rate is     —far below  countries like spain  the overall unemployment rate of      looks  better because companies are hunkering down and retaining staff in the  hope of a recovery  this happens when economies slump  adults are

   the leaders of the association of south east asian nations  asean  gather for their  th summit on the indonesian island of bali this week  it seems to be a popular club now  any country with even a remote interest in the asia pacific region wants to join  or at least sit in  a bewildering array of what they like to call “asean centric” summits and organisations have been created to accommodate the newcomers  from india to new zealand  from china to russia    thus a modern asean summit has become a series of summits and bilateral meetings  scheduled for consecutive days  the climax this year will be the appearance of president barack obama himself to signal america’s official accession to the east asia summit  a relatively new grouping of the asean ten  plus eight others  more than ever  it all heralds a feeling that this really will be the asian century  mr obama himself said it again again  wednesday  however  the asean agenda this year will focus not so much on proud new asia  but probably more on floundering old europe  as at the g  meeting in france recently  the euro crisis has forced its way onto the agenda  the asean related economic discussions  in particular  could well focus on what the asian pacific economies can do to avoid contagion from the epidemic spreading across europe  the euro crisis has also been prompting some of the globetrotters in bali to       
   my colleague writes that the european central bank s bond market tactics—choosing to intervene in markets on some occasions and not on others—are proving useful it is understandable that the ecb does not want to back countries like italy in an unlimited way because there is no reason to trust that any one country won’t free ride on ecb liquidity—a risk that other central banks don t face  critics of the ecb have to reconcile their view with the fact that market pressure led to some very important changes and reforms that political pressure could not accomplish the peterson institute s jacob funk kirkegaard expresses a similar view  o nly after italian   year interest rates went past the   percent “nuclear threshold” did financial demands bring about a new government in rome   thus has “regime change” installing new technocratic led governments occurred in two democratic states  resulting from financial market pressure unchecked by the ecb   it is now clear that the ecb under the new presidency of mario draghi  the former governor of the bank of italy  has been vindicated in its strategy of refusing to defend italian bond spreads around the  –  basis points  thereby forcing italy to implement the reforms the central bank sought in august  in the end  it was the italian political class that blinked first in this latest game of chicken and pushed berlusconi out if there

   in september  cuadrilla resources  the first company to drill for shale gas in britain  estimated that   trillion cubic feet of gas lie in an area of lancashire near blackpool  in northwest england  on the basis of two well points in the area  it predicted that there were nearly   times the previous projections of all of britain’s shale resources  it is likely that  even if accurate  only a small proportion of such reserves might actually be recoverable  so far  so good  but there was a problem  in may  the company had to stop drilling because two tiny tremors were recorded in the region  these were so small—    and     magnitude—that they would barely have been felt  nonetheless  exploration was halted over concerns that the seismic activity had been caused by deep drilling and hydraulic fracturing or “fracking”  the process by which huge volumes of water are blasted through rock at high pressure in order to extract the gas  the company commissioned a report by a team of independent seismic experts  that report  geomechanical study of bowland shale seismicity  came out today  and found that it was “highly probable” that cuadrilla’s activity did cause the shocks  it reckons they were caused by an “unusual combination of geology at the well site coupled with the pressure exerted by fracking”  mike stephenson of the british geological survey says he is not surprised at the

   the energy efficiency of computing is doubling every   months in   gordon moore  a co founder of intel  first observed that integrated circuits  better known as silicon chips  seemed to conform to a predictable law  since their invention in    the density of components in each chip had doubled each year  and this trend was  he suggested  likely to continue for at least a decade  in   dr moore modified his prediction  observing that component density was doubling every two years  in practical terms  the result is that personal computer performance doubles every   months  and has done so for decades  a prediction commonly known as moore’s law  as computers have become mobile devices  however  their users are increasingly concerned about battery life as well as raw performance  so they will welcome a new analysis  by jonathan koomey of stanford university and his colleagues  which seems to have uncovered a deeper law relating to the energy efficiency of computers  dating back to the era of vacuum tubes  the researchers found that the electrical efficiency of computing has doubled every     years since the mid  s  “that means that for a fixed amount of computational power  the need for battery capacity will fall by half every     years ” observes dr koomey  this trend  he says  “bodes well for the continued explosive growth in mobile computing  sensors and

   the x ray body scanners that are found in some airports in america have been banned in the european union  doubts have long persisted about the safety of these machines  which emit a minute amount of radiation  and the eu has explicitly linked such doubts to its decision  announced at the start of the week  as the press release has it in order not to risk jeopardising citizens  health and safety  only  security scanners which do not use x ray technology are added to the  list of authorised methods for passenger screening at eu airports that s not exactly going to cheer up american travellers  who are already struggling to understand why the transportation security administration decided that the x ray scanners were suitable for them to use  another kind of body scanner is available  which uses radiofrequency technology that   has not been linked to cancer scares  these are installed in some american airports  such as atlanta and dallas  and will be the scanner of choice in europe siim kallas  the eu transport commissioner  explained some of the reasoning behind the decision security scanners are not a panacea but they do offer a real possibility to reinforce passenger security   security scanners are a valuable alternative to existing screening methods and are  very efficient in detecting both metallic and non metallic objects  it  is still for each member state or airport       
   who s popping what in the european union  cocaine related offences committed in the european union rose    between   and    according to the latest annual report from the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction  but the figures looked to be stabilising in the last couple of years  perhaps because the drug s price made it less appealing during a period of economic hardship  in   some    m europeans between the ages of   and   took cocaine  though prevalence varied in individual countries from      in romania and greece to      in estonia  on the other hand ecstasy usage  which has often been linked to the dance music scene  has been going steadily downwards  and dropped    during the same period  but it is cannabis that dominates the numbers  of the     offences reported in the european union for the use or possession of drugs in    over three quarters related to the weed  indeed only in the czech republic and latvia—where methamphetamines predominate—and malta—where cocaine causes more problems—was cannabis pipped as the largest cause of drug related offences    
   over the last   hours  a couple of contacts have posed an intriguing question  has the latest stage of the euro zone debt crisis been part of a cunning plan  both greece and italy are forming technocratic governments and berlusconi has finally gone  by the end of this week  indeed  the governments of all five countries in the piigs grouping  portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain  will have changed since the start of the crisis if  as expected  the ruling socialists lose power in spain  the prospects for economic reform in the peripheral european countries look a lot stronger than before who is behind this plan  one could point the finger at angela merkel or at the european central bank  by not giving the peripheral nations a blank cheque from the german voters  or unlimited money creation  they have forced those nations to make hard choices if it is a plan  then  to quote blackadder  it has been  more cunning than a fox who s been appointed professor of cunning at oxford university   until this autumn  the apparent aim of all the eu s rescue packages was to stop the crisis spreading to italy and spain  it has spread to both  indeed  the borrowing costs of supposedly core countries like france and the netherlands have been rising relative to those of germany  although it grew in q   the euro zone may now be in recession  that can hardly have been part of the plan if       
   constructive criticism  from a britain at the heart of eu decision making  that was the new tone on europe from david cameron this evening  as he climbed into white tie and tails and gave his annual lord mayor s banquet speech on foreign policy to believe the rather lazy instant headlines  the prime minister took the same eurosceptic line at the mansion house tonight as he did in the house of commons last month  when he tried to head off a european rebellion by describing the euro crisis as a great opportunity to advance britain s national interests according to the bbc  for example  mr cameron used tonight s speech to say that   the current turmoil in europe is an opportunity for the uk to  refashion  its relationship with brussels   the daily telegraph  meanwhile  asserts in its report that   the prime minister insisted that leaving the eu was “not in our national    interest” but said he felt “very personally” that now was the time for a    fundamental reconsideration of european relations  actually  mr cameron s speech was more subtle than that  and more pragmatic than his house of commons intervention last month  that october statement was calculated to leave the impression with mps that the prime minister shared their yearning to hijack future eu treaty changes and demand back a raft of powers from the eu under threat of a british veto  with mr cameron differing with       
   while we re on the subject of just what it means to be european  let me direct your attention to this week s print edition  which contains a special report on the euro crisis by the economist s foreign editor  ed carr  t he crisis that has engulfed the european union  eu  is about much more than the euro  as government bonds  share prices and banks swoon and global recession knocks on the door  the first fear is of financial and economic collapse  but to understand what is happening to the currency you also need to look at what is happening to europe the euro will not be safe until europe answers some fundamental questions that it has run away from for many years  at their root is how its nations should respond to a world that is rapidly changing around them  what will it do as globalisation strips the west of the monopoly over the technologies that have made it rich  and an ageing europe starts to look increasingly like the western peninsula of a resurgent asia some europeans would like to put up carefully designed fences around the eu’s still vast and wealthy market  others  including a growing number of populist politicians  want to turn their nations inward and shut out not just the world but also the elites’ project of european integration  and a few—from among those same elites  mostly—argue that the only means of paying for europe’s distinctive way of life is not to       
   few countries in the region arouse more concern than hungary and few politicians arouse more controversy than its prime minister  viktor orbán  critics see him as the harbinger of authoritarian rule  presiding over the imminent collapse of the economy   see here for a round up of recent economist pieces  it is worth aiming off a little given that the critics are mostly  though not all  mr orbán s political rivals  hungary s  economic difficulties are serious  the combination of large foreign currency debts and a weakening forint is especially alarming   it is more vulnerable to the chaos in the euro zone than any of the nearby countries  but to be fair  hungary is no longer in the intensive care ward as it was when the imf bailed it out in    mr orbán inherited a mess and has  thanks to some bruising  and in some cases questionable  measures  brought public finances under control similarly it is easy to exaggerate criticism of mr orbán s political approach  his headstrong way with public institutions can seem like a power grab  until you remember that hungary s political system is based on the idea of  winner takes all   the fidesz party that he leads gained a hefty mandate in the   elections and has since then  quite rightly in his supporters  eyes  carrying out his mandate of stabilisation and reform  if that means biffing a few foreign       
   i was determined to avoid writing about the europe this week  there is a lot of it about in other sections of the paper  and i do not want to start sounding like a sad euro obsessive  at least  more than i already do   i have only partly succeeded i managed to avoid writing about the european union  but  little noticed amid the clanging of fire bells and wailing of sirens in the euro zone  this week marked the start of a six month campaign by britain to reform another branch of  europe   namely the european court of human rights in strasbourg  that story was too important to ignore  so i have written a piece about it for the britain section in this week s print edition  sorry about that on november  th  britain took over the rotating half year chairmanship of the body that runs the strasbourg court  the council of europe  a   nation rights guardian founded shortly after the second world war  not to be confused with the   member eu  in the normal run of things  britain s chairmanship of a body as obscure as the council of europe would not set many pulses racing  but rulings by the strasbourg court—which considers complaints based on the european convention of human rights—have been creating banner headlines of late  it was the strasbourg court which ordered britain to rethink a blanket ban on prisoners voting  following a complaint from a litigious british prisoner serving

    by  rebecca wilder      ea bop guide  ca and ka – ea too dependent on portfolio inflows       this is part two of my multi post commentary on the euro area balance of payments  bop     yesterday  in part one   i compared the ea current account balance to its country level cross section  today’s post will be more instructive in nature  as i dig into the components of the ea current account  ca  and capital account  ka  balances     my general conclusion is that the ea is highly dependent on foreign demand for ea assets in the identity of its international accounts     as a note  remember the standard international finance identity  ca   ka   errors and omissions      where ca   ka is generally referred to as the balance of payments  an international  guide to the bop can be found at the imf website    generally  the ea bop statistics adhere to the imf definitions      the current account     the chart below illustrates the   month accumulated current account balance as the sum of its components  the goods balance  exports minus imports of goods   the service balance  exports minus imports of services   net foreign income  and unilateral transfers  the goods  services  and income balance is €     for the three months ending in september  which is more than offset by the unilateral transfer balance   €     billion     the transfer debits are generally to and from other eu institutions and other non eu and non g  countries  see  section      table      which reflects subsidies from the ea to eu budgets  remittance payments  and aid to developing economies  given the stability in these outflows  this should be no cause for concern at this time  of note  the goods balance shrunk spanning   to current  while the service balance improved  in q     the goods balance was just €  billion  while the services balance was €      the trade and income balances balances generally fund the transfer outflows  however  recently the transfer balance has picked up   €    bn in the three months ending in september  which is up from  €  or  €  bn in the same month of   and     given the dropoff in the trade and income balance  something is funding these unilateral outflows  the capital account                 the capital account     the chart below illustrates the   month accumulated capital account balance as a sum of its components  net portfolio flows  port inv – bal  generally financial assets   foreign direct investment  fdi  or stickier capital flows   financial derivatives  ‘other investments’  and official reserves  ecb asset accumulation      since the crisis started  there’s been an stark inflow of foreign money  positive green bars  into the euro area  it’s probably worth looking at this alongside the us tic data to gauge interest in usd denominated assets for a proxy of global portfolio diversification – another post – i digress  the ea foreign direct investment is  and has generally been  negative  foreign direct investment is long term investment in other countries  including the retention of earnings for investment  equity investment  or long and short term loans  most of the fdi is leaving the ea for the uk  ‘other eu countries  those not uk  sweden  or denmark  and “other countries”  likely em countries in asia and latin america   you can see this information in  section      table     official reserve asset accumulation is generally very small – one can barely see it in this illustration    and picks up in times of stress  like in        one interesting aspect of this data has been the persistently negative flows in ‘other investments’   section      tables      indicate this is driven by outflows in the banking sector  mfi’s   i’ll attend to this in another post  but there’s been a steady reduction to ea mfi’s via short term loans            the important feature of recent developments in the capital account is the sharp dropoff of the portfolio balance in september  just €    bn over the last three months from €    bn in the three months through august  this could be a one off event  but the reduced foreign demand for ea assets could be problematic if a trend forms     i would say that the ea bop is not the most stable of all international flows  it’s now heavily dependent on portfolio flows – the green bars in the chart above   given the persistently negative foreign direct investment flows  better put  the ea current account deficit is now funding through international asset flows into debt  equity  and lending markets  given the deterioration of the sovereign debt crisis  i wouldn’t be surprised if these flows slowed further in coming months quarters without a broad policy response from within europe  given the persistence of the transfer outflows  waning foreign demand for ea assets would pressure the currency downward if trade remains sluggish     originally published at  the wilder view   economonitors       
   by  mike kime l    peter diamond  emmanuel saez  paul krugman and me    looking at optimal tax rates   via  paul krugman   i learned of  this paper  by peter diamond and emmanuel saez   diamond  of course  is a nobel laureate   i will be shocked if saez isn t one too in ten or fifteen years   long story made very short  diamond and saez jump through a lot of hoops and find that the optimal top marginal income tax rate  all in  that is  including federal  state and local   which they define as maximizing social welfare  is about        now  long time readers may recall i ve been doing this sort of analysis for years  though of course i ve been looking at tax rates that maximize real gdp growth   simply put  you cannot maximize long run social welfare if you aren t maximizing economic growth       my approach is much simpler than that followed by diamond and saez   i like to think its much more intuitive and easier to explain   i note that us data shows a simple quadratic relationship between real gdp growth from one year to the next and tax rates   growth in real gdp  t to t     f top marginal tax rate  top marginal tax rate squared  other variables   one recent post on the topic is  here       unlike the laffer curve   the coefficients come out statistically significant and with the right signs      i mention all this to note that no matter what i throw into the equation  i find that the top marginal tax rate that maximizes economic growth is somewhere around      of course  i ve focused only on federal tax rates    add in state and local it comes pretty close to what diamond and saez have found   as i noted above  my approach is somewhat simpler  and easier to follow than that of diamond and saez   part of the reason is that they come at it from a point of view of elasticities   but with all due respect to my betters  diamond and saez  and krugman as well considering the explanation in his post  i think this is the wrong way to consider the problem   it requires all sorts of assumptions and generalizations about people s behavior  some of which are both false and create resistance from folks on the right     for example  there is a notion that raising tax rates will reduce people s willingness to work    which is only true above certain thresholds    that threshold  of course  varies per individual    as anyone who has ever had a business will tell you  when they re not busy demanding tax reductions   you don t pay taxes on income from the business if you turn around and reinvest that income    an accountant would talk to you about decreasing your tax liability by increasing expenses which amounts to the same thing    you only pay taxes on that income you take that income out  presumably for consumption purposes   so to simplify  consider an example      is a successful businessperson more likely to take money out of the business if his her tax rate is    or if its      in general  a person is more likely to take that money at     as there s less of a penalty   at    tax rates  there is more of an incentive to reinvest in the business  creating more growth in the business in subsequent years  and more economic growth thereafter      tax rates are more likely to generate faster economic growth than    tax rates precisely because people are self interested and the higher tax rates induce people to continue investing in things they do well    of course  tax rates can get too high   at     people will reinvest almost every dime    even if they have exhausted every good investment opportunity they have   thus  to avoid taxes they ll be making lousy investments which in turn slow economic growth      still  its gratifying to see others who are more  er  credentialed doing similar work   if i might end on a digression  though  i can think of a number of examples of work being done on blogs by people who are essentially hobbyists which is somewhat ahead of the academic literature   however  to a large extent  if something wasn t published in the academic literature  for all practical purposes it didn t happen   which is a shame  because most of us who aren t academics don t have time or the resources required for such publication  such as access to econlit    that inevitably slows economic development three ways       the lack of recognition discourages hobbyists who have the potential and otherwise would have the willingness to improve on the existing literature     should such hobbyists persist and do the research  that research will not be widely disseminated even if it is an improvement over the academic literature     it maintains an insular attitude among those who are not hobbyists   as smart as diamond  saez  and krugman all are  none of them are thinking the way someone running a business thinks of they d have realized immediately how people who are running a business react to higher and lower tax rates   i have read a lot of academic papers on taxation and have yet to stumble on one that gets it right         thanks to steve roth of  asymptosis  and jazzbumpa of  retirement blues  for notifying me of krugman s post     and since i always offer     if anyone wants any spreadsheets showing the quadratic relationship between tax rates and economic growth or anything else i ve done  drop me a line   i m at my first name  mike  then a period then my last name  kimel   with one m only     at gmail com       
   by   mike kimel    in this post  i will show that during the new deal era  changes in the real economic growth rate can be explained almost entirely by the earlier changes in federal government s non defense spending  there are going to be a lot of words at first   but if you re the impatient type  feel free to jump ahead to the graphs  there are three of them   the story i m going to tell is a very keynesian story  in broad strokes  when the great depression began in    aggregate demand dropped a lot  people stopped buying things leading companies to reduce production and stop hiring  which in turn reduced how much people could buy and so on and so forth in a vicious cycle  keynes  approach  and one that fdr bought into  was that somebody had to step in and start buying stuff  and if nobody else would do it  the government would      so an increase in this federal government spending would lead to an increase in economic growth  even a relatively small boost in government spending  in theory  could have a big consequences through the multiplier effect   the government hires some construction companies to build a road  those companies in turn purchase material from third parties and hire people  and in the end  if the government spent x  that could lead to an effect on the economy exceeding x    this increased spending by the federal government typically came in the form of roads and dams  the ccc and the wpa and the tennessee valley authority  in the bureau of economic analysis  national income and product accounts  nipa  tables it falls under the category of nondefense federal spending   now  in a time and place like the us in the early  s  it could take a while for such nondefense spending by the federal government to work its way through the economy  commerce moved more slowly back in the day  it was more difficult to spend money at the time than it is now  particularly if you were employed on building a road or a dam out in the boondocks  you might be able to spend some of your earnings at a company store  but presumably the bulk of what you made wouldn t get spent until you get somewhere close to civilization again    so let s make a simple assumption   let s say that according to this keynesian theory we re looking at  growth in any given year a function of nondefense spending in that year and the year before  let s keep it very simple and say the effect of nondefense spending in the current year is exactly twice the effect of nondefense spending in the previous year  thus  restated        change in economic growth  t    f       change in nondefense spending t         change in nondefense spending t     for the change in economic growth  we can simply use growth rate of real gdp at time t less growth rate of real gdp at time t    the growth rate of real gdp is provided by the bea in an easy to use spreadsheet  here    now  it would seem to make sense that nondefense spending could simply be adjusted for inflation as well  but it isn t that simple  our little keynesian story assumes a multiplier  but we re not going to estimate that multiplier or this is going to get too complicated very quickly  particularly given the large swing from deflation to inflation that occurred in the period  what we can say is that from the point of view of companies that have gotten a federal contract  or the point of view of people hired to work on that contract who saved what they didn t spend in their workboots  or storekeepers serving those people  they would have spent more of their discretionary income if they felt richer and would have spent less if they felt poorer    and an extra   million in nondefense spending  i e   contracts coming down the pike  will seem like more money if its a larger percentage of the most recently observed gdp than if its a smaller percentage of the most recently observed gdp  put another way  context for nondefense spending in a period of rapid swings in deflation and inflation can be provided by comparing it to last year s gdp    so let s rewrite equation     as follows       growth in real gdp t   growth in real gdp t   f       change in  nondefense spending t   gdp t            change in  nondefense spending t     gdp t      put another way    this simple story assumes that changes in the growth rate in real gdp  i e   the degree to which the growth rate accelerated or decelerated  can be explained by the rate at which nondefense spending as a perceived share of the economy accelerated or decelerated  thus  when the government increased nondefense spending  as a percent of how big the people viewed the economy  quickly  that translated a rapid increase in real gdp growth rates  conversely  when the government slowed down or shrunk nondefense spending  real gdp growth rates slowed down or even went negative    note that gdp and nondefense spending figures are  midyear  figures  note also that at the time  the fiscal year ran from july to june    so the amount of nondefense spending that showed up in any given calendar year would have been almost completely determined through the budget process a year earlier    as an example    nondefense spending figures for   were made up of nondefense spending through the first half of the year  which in turn were determined by the budget which had been drawn up in the first half of    in other words  equation     explains changes in real gdp growth rates based on spending determined one and two years earlier  if there is any causality  it isn t that growth rates in real gdp are moving the budget   since there stories are cheap  the question of relevance is this  how well does equation     fit the data  well  i ll start with a couple graphs  and then i ll ramp things up a notch  below the fold     figure   below shows the right hand side of equation     on the left axis  and the left hand side of equation     on the right axis   sorry for reversing axes  but since the right hand side of the equation     leads it made sense to put it on the primary axis            notice that the changes in nondefense spending growth and the changes in the rate of real gdp growth correlate very strongly  despite the fact that the former is essentially determined a year and two years in advance of the latter    here s the same information with a scatterplot          so far  it would seem that either the government s changes to nondefense spending growth were a big determinant of real economic growth  or there s one heck of a coincidence  particularly since i didn t exactly  fit  the nondefense function   but as i noted earlier in this post  after the first two graphs  i would step things up a notch  that means i m going to show that the fit is even tighter than it looks based on the two graphs above  and i m going to do so with a comment and a third graph    here s the comment    figures do not provide information about how the new deal programs worked  after all  the figures are midyear   so the real gdp growth would be growth from midyear   to midyear    but fdr didn t become president until march of      so    here s figure   redrawn  to include only data from   to            while i m a firm believer in the importance of monetary policy  for a number of reasons i don t believe it made much of a difference in the new deal era  as figure   shows  changes in nondefense spending   hiring people to build roads  dams  and the like  explain subsequent changes in real gdp growth rates exceptionally well from   to    this simple model explains more than    of the change in real gdp growth rates over that period    of course  after    the relationship breaks down    but by then the economy was on the mend  despite the big downturn in     more importantly  i believe   haven t checked this yet    defense spending began to become increasingly important  people who might have been employed building roads in   might have found employment refurbishing ships going to the

   by  rebecca wilder    ea balance of payments  the current account   i’ve been doing quite a bit of research on the balance of payments flows within the euro area  ea   given the complexity of the balance of payments  there are too many angles to tackle in one post  therefore  spanning the next week i will dedicate my commentary to the ea balance of payments  in this post  we start with square one  the current account            the euro area  ea  current account     often times i hear comparison of the ea sovereign debt crisis to past emerging market balance of payments crises  this is not correct  since the ea runs only mild current account deficits        of total ea gdp as of q     q  data reported in december   there’s no need for a sharp revaluation of the euro to drive the balance of payments to its identity – remember  the current account  ca    capital account  ka    official reserves   errors ommissions                        the standard emerging market style balance of payments crisis goes something like this  large current account deficits must be financed by foreign inflows of capital  financial account surpluses   so that the currency comes under pressure when foreigners lose confidence in said emerging market economy  as foreign capital flows start to reverse  the currency comes under pressure to balance the financial and current accounts  under currency depreciation  relative costs rise  via imported goods   so the central bank ‘defends’ the level of the currency through fx intervention  they sell down fx reserves and buy the domestic currency   with the central bank’s stock of fx reserves depleting quickly  speculators can sell the domestic currency for much longer than the national central bank can buy up those assets  eventually  the whole thing comes crashing down  the currency depreciates  quite materially in some cases  and brings the current account into balance            the ea initial condition for a balance of payments crisis is just not there  the current account is  well  rather ‘balanced’   within the ea  country level current accounts are well out of balance  this is the central theme associated with the ea sovereign debt crisis  debtor countries are reliant on foreign inflows of capital from the credit countries to support current spending          the chart above illustrates the   quarter moving average current account deficit  red  surplus  green  as a   of national gdp ending in q        in the context of the standard balance of payments crisis  greece and portugal would should have seen precipitous nominal fx depreciation by now  in contrast  the netherlands or germany would have seen significant appreciation  however  the single currency union prevents nominal depreciation  so the focus has been on  real  depreciation  the debtor countries are forced into a policy of internal devaluation  fiscal austerity  they call it  to shift relative prices and real exchange rates  this could work if global growth was going gangbusters  but it’s not     these imbalances are no longer sustainable     i’ll leave you with a link as to the direction we’ll be headed here on the wilder view  last month thomas mayer released a report titled  euroland’s hidden balance of payments crisis   which describes imbalances building in the ea financial flows  next post we’ll look into the balance of payments flows within the ea          originally published at  the wilder view   economonitors        
    by beverly mann     judge brett kavanaugh’s strange political prediction—and other recent aca litigation events     well  as you all probably know by now  there have been two major developments in the courts within the last two weeks on the litigation challenging the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act  the aca  a k a   “obamacare   on november    a three judge panel of the federal appeals court for washington  d c  issued its ruling in a case challenging the constitutionality of the so called individual mandate requiring everyone who can afford healthcare insurance to purchase it  upon penalty of payment of a regulatory fee  that  of course  is the issue that has gotten almost all of the news media attention  thanks to loud tea party republican pol rightwing talk show personalities cries that the mandate unconstitutionally violates individual liberty and therefore is beyond congress’s authority under the constitution’s commerce clause        the commerce clause gives congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and  under supreme court precedent  pretty much anything that affects interstate commerce  it is the “enumerated power” under which the aca was enacted  as opposed to  say  the taxing “enumerated” power      in several earlier ab posts   including one about the oral argument in late september in the appeal that was decided by last week’s ruling  i said that the right wing’s conflation of the limits of congress’s authority under the commerce clause and the separate issue of the constitution’s various limitations on government power to infringe upon individual liberty  including in the fifth amendment’s due process clause limiting the federal government’s powers to infringe upon individuals’ rights  is a sophism  as a matter of law and as a matter of logic  i also said that the due process argument is fatuous  the federal government clearly has the authority under the  taxing  power to compel the purchase of medical insurance or retirement savings  and does so for medicare and social security  and a mandate under the commerce power infringes no more on individual liberty than a mandate under the taxing power     i made these points originally in  an ab post in late june   a few days before sixth circuit court of appeals judge jeffrey sutton  a highly regarded conservative reagan appointee prominent federalist society member who early in his career served for a year as a law clerk to justice scalia  eloquently deconstructed that conflation in his     majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of individual mandate  i reiterated the points in an ab post  about  the sutton opinion   which i sillily titled “judge sutton channels … me  ”    and i summarized them in  a post in early october  in which i discussed the oral argument in the appeal that was decided on november     the sixth circuit opinion was the first appellate ruling on an aca case  the dissenter in that opinion is not an appellate judge but instead a trial level judge sitting on that appellate panel “by designation ” of that court’s chief judge via a statute that allows this  and whose dissenting opinion was breathtakingly lightweight      in august  an eleventh circuit panel consisting of a clinton appointee to the court of appeals who had been appointed as a trial level judge by reagan  another clinton appointee  and a george h  w  bush appointee  issued a     opinion ruling the individual mandate provision unconstitutional but upholding the remainder of the aca  saying that the remainder was “severable” from the individual mandate provision—that is  that the remainder of the act could stand on its own and that therefore the loss of the mandate provision did not dissolve the remainder of the statute  the opinion was written by the reagan appointee  joel dubina and joined by clinton appointee frank hull  neither judge is considered a star legal analyst  and the opinion didn’t disappoint  it was a rote adoption of the the individual mandate unconstitutionally infringes on liberty because it penalizes inaction and therefore congress exceded its commerce clause authority  the opinion doesn’t explain how a supposed unconstitutional infringement of liberty amounts to a  per se  exceeding of congress’s  commerce  power  the opinion doesn’t explain  alchemy  the dissent by judge stanley marcus is scathing   more about this case below    the panel in the washington  d c  case  the one decided on november    like the panel in the sixth circuit case  was comprised of two conservative republican appointees and a democratic appointee  both republican appointees  lawrence silberman and brett kavanaugh  the latter a former law clerk for judge kennedy  are high profile stalwart conservatives and both are intellectual leaders of the “movement” right  albeit from slightly different conservative legal movement eras  silberman is a reagan appointee  kavanaugh a george w  bush appointee  in any event  they are not just rightwing but also considered intelligent  if not necessarily by me   in  my post last month about the oral argument  in that case  i wrote    sutton’s analysis exposes the constitutional challenges to the individual mandate for what they are  a series of ideological clichés masquerading as legal argument   as i wrote in ab shortly after the sutton opinion was released  his analysis is so fine  so precise  that ultimately the supreme court’s opinion will echo it   so i was not among those who were surprised that the administration is pushing for a supreme court ruling on the constitutionality or the statute before the   election   but all the judges thus far who have voted to invalidate the individual mandate provision as unconstitutional are  in my opinion  intellectual lightweights  and so i’d wondered whether the sutton analysis itself could be persuasively deconstructed by a judge or justice who is not      the answer appears to be no   last week  a panel of yet federal appellate court  this one the one for washington  d c   heard arguments in yet another case challenging the constitutionality of the mandate as beyond congress’s commerce regulation authority because it infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain self insured  it requires the purchase of a “product” from a private party  and  well  um  the scope of the statute is really sweeping   i mean  what’s next  asked one of the two stalwart rightwing intellectual heavyweight members of the panel   congress mandating the purchase of gm cars by the wealthy in order to prevent the collapse of that company during the next economic downturn  upon pain of payment of a penalty for failure to do so    i hope so  then  when david koch has a heart attack in his maserati and the ambulance attendants verify through the secretary of state’s offices in his various home states that there is no gm car registered in his name  the attendants dump his gasping for breath body in the road  where he’s run over by a cadillac suv   i followed those paragraphs with this one    a sigh of relief was in order—although i had to wait until i stopped smiling like a cheshire cat   that judge  brett kavanaugh  a former law clerk to justice kennedy  circa     reportedly commented earlier to the plaintiffs’ lawyer that maybe the courts shouldn’t interfere with what could be the beginning of the mass privatization of the social safety net   more likely  i think  it will prompt  finally  a single payer healthcare insurance system—medicare for all—in order to cut out the spiraling costs of a private  multi carrier  for profit system whose premiums reflect  in part the investment losses of those private companies   but don’t tell judge kavanaugh until after that appeal is over    um  oops  actually  it was silberman  not kavanaugh  who suggested that if the individual mandate in the aca is constitutional  then a mandate requiring the purchase of a gm car might be  too  it  was   however  kavanaugh who predicted  mouth watering  that if the aca’s mandate is upheld  it might usher in a mass privatization of the social safety net     when the panel decided the case  it was silberman who wrote the opinion—for himself and the democratic appointee  liberal clinton appointee harry edwards  upholding the individual mandate and echoing the basics of judge sutton’s opinion  that the commerce clause gives congress the authority to regulate that which affects an interstate market  as the healthcare market clearly is  that the decision to not purchase healthcare insurance is not inactivity but instead clearly market activity because  unlike the proverbial decisions whether to purchase broccoli  or a gm vehicle  virtually everyone will need healthcare at some point  and will receive it whether or not the person is insured or can afford to pay the medical bills out of pocket  that the infringement of individual liberty objection is not a commerce clause issue but instead a due process issue  and that the individual mandate provision does not unconstitutionally infringe upon individual liberty     silberman’s opinion adopts sutton’s reasoning in all respects  most interesting  i think—partly  i guess  because by now i feel like i have a proprietary interest in it—is his conclusion that    appellants’ view that an individual cannot be subject to commerce clause regulation absent voluntary  affirmative acts that enter him or her into  or affect  the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that seems more redolent of due process clause arguments  but it has no foundation in the commerce clause    kavanaugh dissented  but not on  liberty  grounds  and not even on commerce clause grounds  instead  he said a court ruling now is premature  for two reasons   one  he said  compelled by statute  the other  he said  in deference to  the bedrock principle of judicial restraint that courts avoid prematurely or unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions        unnecessarily  being the interesting part of this      the statutory reason is his interpretation of a federal court jurisdiction statute called the anti injunction act and of the legal nature of the mandate provision  the anti injunction act removes the “jurisdiction ” i e   legal authority  of the courts to even consider the challenge to the individual mandate provision and its penalty for failure to purchase insurance until after the effective date of that provision in   and the penalty is assessed against someone who then sues for reimbursement  contesting the provision’s constitutionality  the issue depends on whether the penalty is a  tax   since the anti injunction act applies only to taxes  in august  a panel of the fourth circuit court of appeals ruled       that the mandate is a tax and that the act therefore removed the courts’ jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the mandate provision until    when the first penalties would be assessed by the i r s  kavanaugh bought the argument  silberman and edwards didn’t      the “unnecessarily” reason has subparts  but the main ones are that congress may repeal the aca  or parts of it  before the individual mandate provision becomes effective  and  more to the point  or at least more to  my  point   that congress may instead simply change the wording of the mandate provision slightly so that the penalty is clearly a tax  which  he says  clearly would be constitutional     he doesn’t say that it would be clearly within congress’s taxing power  he says  flatly  that it would be clearly constitutional  he says  in other words  that the infringement on liberty does not itself violate the constitution—whether the mandate is an exercise of congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce or instead an exercise of congress’s power to tax     that kavanaugh has an ideological ulterior motive which advertised at oral argument and reiterates with more elaboration in his dissenting opinion— his expectation that if the aca’s mandate is upheld  it could herald an era of mass privatization of the social safety net  happily marrying tea party types and rightwing interests in having government create a market serving private business interests—does not matter  nor does it matter that kavanaugh is delusional—unless  of course  it really is likely that there is  say  a private food assistance lobby similar in number to the insurance industry lobby that  like the insurance industry lobby did in fighting single payer healthcare insurance proposals  and even the so called public option in a version of obamacare    will emerge like locusts to have congress enact a law mandating that everyone who can afford to do so must purchase food stamps each year  redeemable when and if necessary  or that the aarp will agitate for privatization of social security  maybe in order to prevent the government from funding massive otherwise unfunded wars and massive tax cuts for the wealthy largely by tapping the ostensible social security trust fund     no  what matters is that kavanaugh said what he said  irrespective of his motive  kavanaugh got it right  the individual mandate provision does not violate the constitution’s limitations on government infringement of individual liberty  and sutton and silberman  neither of whom appears to share kavanaugh’s peculiar delusion and ulterior motive  but also neither of whom voted for obama or any member of congress who voted for his “care ” have enunciated so finely why this is so and why  also  the mandate provision is within congress’s commerce clause authority  that a     supreme court ruling to the contrary would be a transparent act of ideology  it’s not  of course  that the majority doesn’t do this  regularly  they do  it’s that this time they would be eating not only obama and care  but also kavanaugh  sutton and silberman     the fat lady hasn’t sung yet on the constitutionality of the individual mandate  but i think it’s over nonetheless  when the court decides that issue—and despite the out of right field potential inherent in certain sort of breathtaking parts of the court’s order last monday agreeing to hear the eleventh circuit case—i think the court  will  decide that issue  eventually  if not in that case     for the specifics of that order  and a comprehensive discussion of the five parts to it and the possible implications of one of them  see simon lazarus and dahlia lithwick’s article in slate  “the medicaid ambush  the supreme court s unexpected and astounding reasons for wanting to hear a challenge to obamacare ”  here                 if the court rules the aca unconstitutional because the majority thinks the aca’s expansion of medicaid provision violates the states’  um  constitutional right to the current federal statutory entitlement  medicaid in its current form  in order to protect the popularity of the states’ legislators who would vote to forego medicaid in order to avoid the requirements of obamacare  see the slate article   then of course the court will never have to decide the constitutionality of the individual mandate  i don’t think it will buy the states’ hubristic claim  i think the court simply wants to hear all challenges from all governments that are suing  this is a court with at least a few members who apparently think that any time a state or local government asks it to hear a case  it should hear the case  but it also is a court whose majority  in deciding cases  regularly privileges the states’ interests over the interests of the federal government and of individuals  their ideology largely rejects the fourteenth amendment and the original constitution’s supremacy clause  so  who knows     as for what caused silberman’s change of heart about whether the individual mandate unconstitutionally infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain uninsured  i have two theories  one is that kavanaugh read my ab post attributing to him silberman’s oral argument comment equating the mandate with a theoretical mandate to purchase a gm car  and after explaining to silberman the difference between the two and insisting that silberman publicly clarify the distinction or make clear that he  not kavanaugh  drew the analogy  lest a gasping for air david koch be dumped by an ambulance attendant onto the street and run over by a cadillac escalade and that kavanaugh be blamed  he persuaded silberman to change his mind about the whole analogy  the other is that silberman himself gave more thought to whether it would be such a bad thing after all for the government to mandate a gm car in every driveway  after all  that new chevy cruze is awfully cute and gets pretty good gas mileage        
   by  run     in response to  newt gingrich s  comments on failing schools  work  and rising bootstraps    peter dorman at  econospeak  replies in    education with a twist—an oliver twist         why take it out on the janitors  if the school was failing it wasn’t their fault  according to gingrich  it’s the teachers who can’t make the grade  so why not put the kids to work following lesson plans  going over last year’s standardized tests  etc   there would be as much pride in this as in cleaning toilets       usually when we focus on schools  the focus is on the failing city school model  teachers  and then the students themselves  one commenter draws the following conclusion        i spent weekend pass time as an english conversation resource person at a high school in taejon  i was able to have a first hand look at how education was done in what was at that time a very poor country with big ambitions  most villages at that time were without running water or electricity and people still wore the traditional clothing  both men and women  there was no doubt that we were in a foreign country     because there was not enough money to provide free public education to everyone  students had to pass examinations starting with what we would call middle school if they were to be allowed to continue  same for high school and  of course  post secondary education         those who could not pass the tests were not accepted  but some children of families with enough money were able to continue their education through private schools  the system was exactly opposite what i had seen in america where private schools were generally the place where many of the most accomplished students were sent       and another       the idea seems to be to give the kids some kind of work other than school work  and to build up a work ethic  which could well be more valuable to them than academics if they are in such a dire situation  i know that a friend of mine who runs a small business says he finds it very hard to hire for low end jobs  too many of his new employees don t really  get  the whole work concept      i expect anybody who comments here is probably at least middle class  the work ethic is something our parents drilled into us by example and through discipline  that s unfortunately not true for a lot of the poor  and it is one reason they have so much trouble improving their lot       is it really the student s fault or have we just taken our own fifties  sixties  and seventies values and applied them to a dysfunctional economy and educational system believing there is still a ray of hope if one works hard enough they can still pull themselves up by their boot straps     maybe it is true that korea has been able to lift the boat of equality for all of it students  but then too when all are at the same level of  efforts to lift the outcome are equally divided and not skewed toward the suburbs over the inner cities  review the difference in tax revenues for detroit as compared to rochester hills  farmington hills  etc  if you wish to see inequality  one way to fix the problem is for detroit to annex the suburbs to provide a better tax base  it is no longer a society which provides an equal chance to all people and the chance for upward mobility we used to experience in the sixties  seventies and eighties is long gone  tom hertz does a nice study defining upward mobility in a short study   understanding upward mobility in america   the days when a good work ethic and a high school diploma being the ticket to the middle class have also disappeared  i am sure you would not solely blame the high unemployment percentage rates on those with just a high school education on a lack of work ethic  and what of college with the high costs of student loans to finance college which has certainly contributed to closing the door on many  i suspect the korean vet went to college on the gi bill the same as i and when it paid for tuition  loyola of chicago used to be     a course in the masters program  i am sure it is more now  dr  elizabeth warren reviews what has happened to the chances to enter the middle class    the coming collapse of the middle class     why is it we are willing to finance prisons at an average      per prisoner and keep captive     of the total adult population  heavily skewed towards minorities  with     being nonviolent  and yet we quibble over financing public schools  is that expenditure for prisoners reaping a better result  maybe we should teach high school students to be prison guards as it is a growing business both private and public  another good and not a terribly long read is dr  james gillian   violence  reflections on a national epidemic    a lack of chance in upward mobility with this generation and the previous ones will result in other economic consequences    are there no prisons    are there no union workhouses          
   by  mike kimel    bank of america  kafka  and i   a continuing relationship   a year and a half ago i wrote a post about how countrywide  by then a division of bank of america  had  filed to foreclose on our home   apparently on the basis that someone with a similar name to the previous owner of the home owed them money   needless to say  we were surprised given that a  we had no relationship with b of a  b  we had made a point to always pay more than was due on our mortgage each month  c  nobody with the name of the person they were trying to collect from had ever owned the home  i ve seen the property records going back to when the house was built  and d  as surreal and the whole thing was  we had to hire an attorney to make the whole mess go away   in part because of that experience  some time after that my wife and i closed out all of our b of a accounts   or so i thought   in the process of closing out my account  our account balance by definition became zero   this is important because when one s balance is below       one is charged a monthly service fee   apparently  we have been assessing monthly service fees since the point where we thought we closed our accounts   it seems that now we are carrying a negative balance that happens to equal a multiple of the service fee on an account that i closed a while ago       now  the supreme court has stated that corporations are essentially similar to a person   but imagine if a person did something like this   imagine what would happen to me  for instance  if i filed papers to foreclose on a branch of b of a using  as an excuse  the fact that someone that b of a had no relationship with owed me money   and what would happen if i followed that up some time later by sending b of a a bill for services they not only had not requested  but had been most vehement that they didn t want   in addition to being charged with fraud  i imagine at this point it would also be considered harassment     in general  a human being behaving this way would face consequences   even a human being well connected enough not to have to worry about being arrested by the cops or prosecuted by the da still has to worry about whether the next time his intended victim would be waiting with a shotgun   b of a  on the other hand  truly has no constraints on its behavior   no matter how unprofitable its behavior  it has been deemed too big to fail   and society  having made the decision to privilege some sociopaths  also implicitly made the decision that everyone else qualifies as prey

   by   mike kimel     scaling to new depths  with scott sumner   i ve been having a bit of back and forth with scott sumner    here  is his latest post  helpfully entitled   a suggestion for mike kimel    his key suggestion     please take a close look at the data from the great depression  before doing more posts claiming i don’t know the facts    he then goes on to point out he s been studying the   period for   years    from there he goes on to explain my first mistake    he insists that fdr’s dollar depreciation program began in october    even though all economic historians agree in began in mid april    when the exchange rate for the dollar began declining  against gold and against other currencies    he insists prices began rising before fdr took office off  which is not true   he presents a graph that he claims shows prices rising before fdr took office  but his graph shows inflation rates  not the price level   in fact  the graph actually supports my argument that inflation didn’t turn positive until after fdr took office   there’s a difference between the rate of inflation and the price level    ok   let s redo the graph showing not inflation but rather the price level   and i ll keep it very simple     i will limit it to two points   well  three  though the third is not exactly on the curve so to speak   as before  i m still using ppi because its the publicly available source most closely related to the prices sumner seems to be discussing  and i ll use the graphics tool at the  federal reserve economic database  fred        figure       the graph shows the ppi for february and march of     fdr took office in march      as i noted in  my previous post     you can see the decline in prices halt and start reversing even before he took office    now  i don t remember arguing that inflation didn t turn positive before then   to me  its a big deal that ppi hit rock bottom and reversed itself   getting out of free fall was in itself a big deal    here s a graph for   to   to give you an idea       figure      note that february   happened to be the low point for ppi during its entire history  and the ppi had been calculated since      but there s another important point in the quote i provided above  namely this    he insists that fdr’s dollar depreciation program began in october    even though all economic historians agree in began in mid april    when the exchange rate for the dollar began declining  against gold and against other currencies     this isn t quite right   as i ll make clear  i don t think the dollar actually depreciated against gold until january     sumner was so insistent on this depreciation occurring before then that i spent a bit of time on google and found a story by  jesse jones   head of the reconstruction finance corporation  about how fdr had him and soon to be treasury secretary morgenthau help him  fdr  revalue the price of gold    now  i am not an economic historian  and i m not sure i know any these days  so for all i know  sumner is correct about what all economic historians agree happened   i am  instead a data guy   i like data   scratch that   i love data   i go through data in my spare time    most of the stuff i do at this blog  for instance  has absolutely nothing to do with my day job   nothing   but its an opportunity to play with data   my wife usually scratches her head wondering why i do this kind of thing  but everyone needs a hobby and i don t watch tv   one thing i ve learned with data is that its generally important to go back as close to the original source of data as possible   another is to know something about your sources   go through the data   read footnotes    so in that spirit  i decided to try see what i can learn by looking for data from the era or thereabouts  ideally coming directly from the folks who collect it   i have not succeeded in finding a series that shows what sumner claims   in fact  data from around that era  particularly on gold prices  isn t easy to come by   but i have found a few examples   for instance  table number   of the    statistical abstract of the united states  shows the supply of gold in the united states on june   of each year  going back annually to    and with selected years before then    the data seems to originate with the treasury and the fed  though i haven t been able to locate the contemporaneous originals    footnote   reads in part    by a proclamation of the president dated jan       the weight of the gold dollar was reduced from     to       grains of gold      fine  the value of gold is therefore based on    per fine ounce beginning june    theretofore it is based on      per fine ounce    in other words a couple months after sumner and other economic historians believe the dollar had started losing value against gold  the fed and or the treasury were reporting to the census  which publishes the statistical abstract  that the price of gold was still exactly the same as it had been     now  its possible the census or the fed or the treasury made a mistake and it went uncorrected by the time of the   statistical abstract    so one source is not enough  especially when sumner and  all economic historians  agree it is wrong    which leads to a fed document called  banking and monetary statistics          this is from the section on gold  bottom paragraph  left hand column  page      all figures are in dollars  calculated at the rate of      per fine ounce of gold through january   and    per fine ounce thereafter  except that the figures for the year   in table   are based upon the    gold price    the change in rate results from the fact that on january       the dollar was devalued by     per cent in terms of gold in accordance with a proclamation issued by the president    if you re curious                          happens to be      of       the document is chock full of tables that show  including other things  the monthly value of us gold holdings     where dollar figures are involved  those tables also carry a helpful note indicating the price as      an ounce through january    and    an ounce thereafter   note that the fed valued monthly holdings at      an ounce in april  may  june  july  august  september  october  november and december of   when  all along  according to scott sumner who spent   years studying the era and  all economic historians   insist the price of gold had been rising at the time   i ve stumbled on a few other sources as well but they don t look any different   i m just not seeing the series that shows the dollar price of gold rising during the months from april   to january      so what is going on   i m going to split the baby here and suggest that both scott sumner and  all economic historians  are right that there was a devaluation  and the fed and the treasury and the statistical abstract of the united states were  and are  right that there wasn t   but the way in which they are right is very definitely not a good thing for scott sumner and  all economic historians    see  as i said above  i m not an economic historian  but i did spend my formative years in south american in the  s and  s   as anyone who spent roughly the same years in the region as i did could tell you  or as any zimbabwean can do today  during times of turmoil  which can last decades  the official exchange rate can come to bear no relationship with the actual price at which a currency trades against something that is considered more stable and more desirable to hold   heck  you don t have to track down someone from arrgentina or zimbabwe   ask any european who ever visited the soviet block and traded in some western currency at the airport or the border about how unrealistic official exchange rates could be   in many an economic basket case  the likelihood that a transaction takes place at anything resembling the official exchange rate is similar to the probability that someone walks into a chevrolet dealership and pays the msrp  in cash    and like the msrp  the official exchange rate has a purpose   yes  there s always someone clueless or coerced enough to pay that price   but for the most part  its a fiction that either serves as a baseline for something or papers over something the government wants to really do  usually printing money   its a handy excuse to get from point a to point b  and if the excuse doesn t fly  another one will do   my guess  and i ll repeat that i m not an economic historian  is that when fdr and jones and morgenthau were picking prices out of the air  it was in that vein   the country was in turmoil when fdr took office  and there were fears that if things got worse there would be an armed insurrection   it wasn t a time for half measures   my guess is the mood in the white house at the time was best summarized by a quote decades later from the immortal john candy   there s a time to think  and a time to act  and this  gentlemen  is no time to think      so what did the fiction of changing the price gold accomplish if nobody else believe that the price had actually changed   i suspect it meant  in practice  that the reconstruction finance corporation could pay more than      an ounce for gold   and why would the rfc  which  i note  could borrow outside the budget  want to pay more than      an ounce for gold if that was the price everyone was accepting   think of the rfc the way you think of the fed trying to bail out banks in recent years   loaning money at below market rates to banks who then used the money to buy treasuries which paid higher rates   in effect  paying more than      an ounce was a way to funnel riskless profits to banks    of course  the rfc often replaced management  but things have gotten permissive as well as more sophisticated in recent decades     which brings us back to sumner and  all economic historians  being right  at least technically   yes  the currency was being devalued throughout much of    but no  it wasn t   not really   there were a series of fictional devaluations that served a specific purpose  but which nobody else made believe was real  and its possible which almost nobody else was aware were happening   don t ask me  i m not an economic historian     pretending otherwise  and using that fictional data to do an analysis is the equivalent of trying to understand the east german economy in   using the exchange rates a traveler would have received at checkpoint charlie during that year      the title comes from a book put out by mad magazine in the  s or  s   sorry i can t be more specific   it has been a while      
   the  washington post  points us to a study on the overall impact of regulations and jobs    the critique of regulations fits into a broader conservative narrative about government overreach  but it also comes after a string of disasters in recent years that were tied to government regulators falling short  including the financial crisis of    the bp oil spill and the west virginia mining accident last year      data  from the  bureau of labor statistics  show that very few layoffs are caused principally by tougher rules     whenever a firm lays off workers   the bureau  asks executives the biggest reason for the job cuts     in        percent of the people who lost their jobs in layoffs were let go because of “government regulations intervention ” by comparison    percent were laid off because of a drop in business demand

   by  linda beale    gop two step approach problematic    discussion continued apace yesterday about the  supercommittee  and the idea of agreeing to agree someday on some revenue increases while going ahead with cuts     this approach is a terrible one since it gives the obstructionist gop members just another setting in which to refuse to go ahead with tax increases and to  negotiate  yet again over just what counts as a revenue increase   like the gimmicks that became so overused in the         bush tax bills  this  deal  is just another gimmick for the radical right to get its way  cuts to social security and medicare  cuts to all programs intended to help the vulnerable  no cuts to military programs  and no tax increases  especially not for the rich     republicans on the right are already arguing for applying  dynamic analysis  which tends  in their versions  to be rosy scenarios of increased growth due to tax cuts      this is a cop out way to claim revenue increases that won t materialize while making actual cuts to much needed social programs   they are also arguing for dramatic changes in the way the earned benefits programs work  such as means testing for recipients  as first steps in working towards outright elimination of those programs   you get comments like those of jim jordan  republican of ohio  who wrote in an op ed in usa today that taxes  should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance    see rubin    debt accord may be two step process  hensarling says   bloomberg  nov            meanwhile  jim jordan  republican of ohio  said in a usa today piece that taxes should not be raised because they  should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance    id      this is a wrongheaded view of taxes   the radical right uses language about taxes  punishing success  because they see defending the rich from  taxation as their mission   the rich are defined as  successful   even if the wealth is merely built on top of inherited wealth and position  and even if the rich did nothing at all to earn the wealth   taxes do not punish success   taxes are the way that we cooperate together to fund important government programs that serve all of us   even when they act as transfer programs that transfer resources to the poor and elderly  they are serving all of us by making our society work better      originally published at  ataxingmatter       
   by  mike kimel    scott sumner digs deeper   scott sumner  criticizes  my most recent post in which i indicate that keynesian theory explains growth rates during the new deal era better than theories proposed by monetarists   he starts by criticizing this  which i wrote in my  earlier post    aggregate demand was very slack when fdr took office   fdr showed up in washington with a plan to start spending a lot of money and thus boost aggregate demand   the immediate effect was to convince factories they d be running down their inventories  that boosted producer prices  it had a much smaller effect on consumer prices because everyone knew the gubmint was going to buy a heck of a lot more producer goods than consumer goods   the government did buy some consumer goods for the various programs  plus there was a spillover effect  but as the graph clearly shows  the action was on the producer side     after a bit of time  the public realized fdr wasn t planning just a one off  but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items  that led them to start using some of their idle capacity  which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory  the rate of price increases thus dropped    gdp increased the fastest rate in the united states peacetime history since data has been kept  there was a big hiccup  of course  in   when the government cut back on spending for a while     sumner s most important point      prices didn’t start rising when fdr came to washington with spending plans  they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar   furthermore  the weekly rise in the wpi index was highly correlated with weekly increases in the dollar price of gold  i e  currency depreciation    and those changes  in gold prices  were caused by explicit statements and actions by fdr   not by fiscal stimulus  which would be expected to appreciate the dollar    ok   using the cool graphical tool from fred  the federal reserve economic database  i generated this graph of the series that from what i can tell seems to be sumner s favorite price index when discussing the period      figure       now  take a gander at the graph   and bear in mind  fdr was inaugurated in march     but everyone knew what he was going to do  spending wise  once he showed up   you can see the decline in prices halt and start reversing even before he took office   additionally  i m not sure what sumner means when he refers to the period when he says fdr  began depreciating the dollar    there was a gold standard in place going back a long time   that means the value of the dollar was its price in gold   the price of gold was      an ounce for decades before fdr took office   it was      an ounce until the gold reserve act of january       when the price of gold was changed to    an ounce    to be precise  the government devalued the dollar on january    the day after the act passed      the peak in the curve came in february    days or at most weeks  the index isn t that precise  after the gold reserve act   put another way     price inflation using sumner s measure peaked when the currency was devalued   that is precisely    the opposite of what sumner wrote     but there are some extenuating circumstances for sumner       the next paragraph summarizes  this story   from the memoirs of jesse jones      it seems that on october       jones  the head of the reconstruction finance corporation and henry morgenthau  then farm credit administrator but soon to be treasury secretary  were told by fdr to come by on october   to devaluing the dollar by changing its relationship with gold   the three men   fdr  morgenthau  and jones  then went about raising the price of gold by fiat between then and january       when prices came to rest at    an ounce  a price where they stayed through     i assume that s what sumner is talking about   so let me modify figure   to only show the period from january to october        figure     now  recall  sumner s evidence that the keynesian view is wrong and the monetary view is right is    prices didn’t start rising when fdr came to washington with spending plans  they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar    and yet     the graph shows very clearly that prices started to rise when fdr came to washington with spending plans  not at the end of october when he began depreciating the dollar   as is very evident from the graph  by that time prices had already been increasing for quite a while   wholesale prices  by october    were up    from the beginning of the year   if you started in october of    it wasn t until december of   before prices increased another        the point is  sumner is wrong   he is very wrong about when prices started to rise   he is also very wrong about why prices started to rise   and since  when  and  why  are assumptions in his model  his model is very wrong     now  for completeness i m going to tackle the other thing sumner mentioned in his post   sumner s critique of me includes this    there are all sorts of the problems with the argument that the inflation of     was caused by expectations of fiscal stimulus   first of all  it’s completely at variance with keynesian theory  which kimel seems to be trying to defend   keynesian theory says demand stimulus doesn’t raise prices when there is “slack ” and there has never been more slack in all of american history than in      the problem for sumner is that keynesian theory is merely an extension of good old fashioned adam smith   prices depend on supply and demand   you can have a good or service go up in price locally even as it goes down everywhere else     as i noted in my earlier post  and he quoted      the immediate effect was to convince factories they d be running down their inventories    after a bit of time  the public realized fdr wasn t planning just a one off  but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items  that led them to start using some of their idle capacity  which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory  the rate of price increases thus dropped    which of course  is very consistent with the timing of events     none of this is to pick on sumner   there s a whole cottage industry dedicated to advancing a story that government spending cannot have a positive effect on the economy during recessions or depressions   the problem for those trying to advance that story is that government spending does seem to correlate with positive effects during those periods   so alternate theories are proposed  and have been proposed for decades   and those theories often make a lot of sense    until you take a close look at the data       
   in the   new york times  today    the  supreme court  on monday agreed to hear a challenge to the    health care overhaul  law  president obama’s signature legislative achievement  the development set the stage for oral arguments by march and a decision in late june  in the midst of the   presidential campaign…    …     appeals from three courts had been vying for the justices’ attention   presenting an array of issues beyond the central one of whether congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so called individual mandate      the supreme court agreed to hear appeals from just one decision  from the united states court of appeals for the  th circuit  in atlanta      the only one so far striking down the mandate   the decision   from a divided three judge panel  said the mandate overstepped congressional authority and could not be justified by the constitutional power “to regulate commerce” or “to lay and collect taxes ”     the appeals court went no further  though  severing the mandate from the rest of the law      on monday  the justices agreed to decide not only whether the mandate is constitutional but also whether  if it is not  how much of the balance of the law  the patient protection and affordable care act  must fall along with it      …    on monday  the justices agreed to consider that question  the justices also said they would consider an intriguing threshold issue     in september  a divided three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit  in richmond  va    ruled that it was premature to decide the case  in light of the anti injunction act  a federal law that bars suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax ” the supreme court had interpreted the term “tax” very broadly for purposes of the law      if the fourth circuit ruling is correct  individuals may not challenge the individual mandate until the first penalty is due in april    on tuesday  a dissenting judge on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  also endorsed that position            
   by  linda beale     super congress wants to have its cake and eat it too     so the democrats and republicans on the so called  super committee  that is supposed to find      trillion in budget reductions increased revenues within a week now thinks it has a solution  let the regular tax committees  finance and ways  amp  means  come up with the tax revenues  while the super committee will go on and specify the spending cuts   see  deficit panel seeks to defer details on raising taxes   new york times  nov            the proposal doesn t sound like anything that the dems on the panel should accept   for a piddling reduction in some of the deductions available to the most affluent individuals  the gop is willing to lower the rate on those individuals to      just more enriching the rich   the dems shouldn t agree to that   especially since grover norquist thinks that any such agreement would be undone immediately  while any stupid agreement the dems make to  reforming   i e   cutting benefits from  the earned benefits programs will be allowed to take place           grover g  norquist  the president of americans for tax reform  whose antitax pledge has been signed by most republicans in congress  said in an interview  “i am not losing any sleep” over the republicans’ latest proposal  mr  norquist said he was confident that  “at the end of the day  the republican house will not pass a tax increase ”      “as a face saving measure ” mr  norquist said  the deficit reduction panel “could give lots of instructions to the tax writing committees ” in complying with those instructions  he said  the house and the senate could pass very different bills   id       it is hard to see why any cuts to the earned benefits programs should be made  social security  medicare and medicaid are more important now than ever because of the weak economy   we are a rich country and we can afford these programs tax    of compensation for social security    and treat all profits interests as compensation income when allocations are received  so that partnerships treat persons as partners only when they have a capital investment in the partnership business     let the military be cut at least    billion   and raise the rest through taxes  especially through a progressive estate tax and through eliminating the character preference for capital gains income      this country is tired of being held hostage by far right radicals  who don t understand that the government acts for the people and who don t give a damn for anybody that isn t in the top    of the income and wealth distribution   we are tired of the radical right s anarchistic actions to prevent the government from borrowing money to carry out important programs   we are tired of the radical right s stupidity about the economy and its reliance on ideological beliefs in  trickle down  programs to justify tax cuts no matter what situation the country is in   we are tired of the radical right s refusal to acknowledge the facts about the failures of the four decade experiment with reaganomics  during which time the large multinational corporations have been allowed to function like quasi sovereigns   we are tired of seeing tax policies that support consolidation of corporate empires and movement of business overseas  while americans lose jobs and watch their wages decline          originally published at  ataxingmatter

    here’s samsung  sticking it to apple and the fanboys  showing a bunch of them queuing up for a stupid iphone while nearby  a delightful young lady caresses her samsung galaxy ii  the suggestion is that it’s a far superior phone and that the long queue of wannabe iphone users are all wrong  even though there’s loads of them and they’ve probably be queuing all night     it’s a bit far fetched  for no other reason than the fact that a group of iphone fanboys would never approach and speak to an attractive woman                    
    have you ever looked at a coffee house and thought that the simple process of paying for a drink and getting a drink in return was just too fiddly  well  thank god starbucks have come up with a payment app for the iphone which is coming to the uk     it’s a one touch ios payment thing and will  hit  these shores from the  th of january next year  you will be able to link your starbucks card with your app using the on screen barcode  you can still get freebies and the like          since it got a release in the usa earlier this year  it’s become the fastest way to pay for coffee  alas  it hasn’t made the process of actually making a cup of coffee any faster  but y’know  what can you do     apparently  one in five starbucks customers in the uk pay for their coffee with their starbucks card  so will they be keen to adopt this new system instead  no word on an android app as yet  so we’ll have to wait and see  either way  technology and coffee  hurray for that or something        
       dixons retail have posted an increase in losses  but hey  they’re happy and everything’s groovy so shut up okay     last year’s annual losses of £   m have become £   m but they say it’ll all be okay because they’re improving their customer service and that’s going to keep us all going back into their loss making establishments  they say that as well as refitting   of their stores  dixons  currys and pc world are focussing on offering more specialist advice to us  the average thick headed punters     it might be working – a survey quoted by the bbc says that    of customers would now be highly likely to recommend the store  compared with    a year ago  ceo john browett said  “in what remains a challenging environment  the pace and impact of improvements in our operating model is driving outperformance versus our competitors and market share gains ”    falls in same store sales from    to    from quarter to quarter suggests that they could be turning things around  throw in the troubles of best buy and comet  and the chance that dixons could grow bigger and stronger again is a possibility     or is it  what do you lot reckon        
    imagine this  you go over to argentina and crisp makers lay’s are so willing to show everyone what goes into their crisps  that they’ve made a vending machine that makes them for you fresh  before your very eyes  there  they show off that the only thing that goes into their product is potatoes  vegetable oil and a pinch of salt     you activate the machine by popping a potato in  then  you watch it get washed  peeled  cut  cooked  salted and bagged up  waiting for you to pluck them out and scoff them  watch                 lay’s machine – debut  english txt   from  castro innovation  on  vimeo      alas  this video is still in the realms of fantasy and only imitates the who process  but someone really ought to make one of these in real life  or we’ll have to cut someone       shortlist         
    it’s almost december  it’s cold  many people may be looking forward to a sparse chrsitmas this year  what better time for energy and climate change secretary chris huhne to announce that the government’s green deal initiative will be loading a massive £  on to the average bill by       at present  the average household pays £  a year on their bills to support the government’s green energy campaign  but this amount is set to rise every year until it hits £  in    the money will be used to provide around £  billion a year towards the £  billion cost of new wind farms  nuclear power stations  a new pylon network and fitting more solar panels  but it’s not all bad news  the government defended the rises saying they will be counteracted by other government policies to help people reduce the amount of energy they use  the department of energy and climate change has confirmed the cost of the various governmental green deal policies in this handy diagram          the diagram shows that average householders who undertake all of the changes to behaviour assumed  including installing smart meters and loft insulation  will actually save money on their energy bills  and these savings  by    will amount to £   note that this is not a discount from energy bills  but is a hypothetical saving on energy costs  that the government can then add their ‘green tax’ to so that bills are up to £  a year cheaper     chris huhne said  yesterday “we will secure our energy at the lowest cost  in the short term by promoting competition  in the medium term by insulating our homes and in the long term by steering us away from excessive reliance on fossil fuels and on to clean  green and secure energy ”    however  with people already struggling with rising energy bills most households are unlikely to be happy about paying more today in order to prevent possible rises in the future  and what about people who are unable to adopt all the green measures  homeowners without attics to insulate or cavity walls will definitely see increased bills owing to government levies     thomas lyon  energy expert at uswitch com said “the big question is over whether the costs are more certain than the benefits  as the success of many of these policies will rely on consumers changing their behaviour or taking up the new options that will be made available to them … the fact is that the uk is on the brink of an affordability crisis when it comes to household energy and it will be difficult for consumers if they have to carry the cost of these policies before seeing the benefit ”    the energy secretary also announced   million homes could be fitted with insulation and other energy saving measures  and householders will be able to take out loans of up to £    over a   year term     however  our consumer friends which  ares warning consumers that this not an energy efficiency grant  the money comes in the form of a loan and anyone taking up the green deal will be expected to pay interest     “it’s difficult to see how hard pressed homeowners will have confidence in how the green deal might work for them if the suggested savings are initially based on averages rather than on their personal energy use ” said richard lloyd  executive director at which      simplification      while it is unlikely governmental levies will be separately disclosed on energy bills  at least one energy company is trying to simplify matters  british gas announced today that all of its tariffs will be scrapped to be replaced with just two options – fixed and variable  changes will be implemented today for new customers and variable customers but existing fixed customers will run to the end of their current term  and then move onto the new tariff     british gas md phil bentley admitted that some bills would go up  as in the past british gas had offered cheap deals that were unsustainable and were loss making for the company  who made a profit of £ m in    british gas increased gas prices by  pc and electricity prices by  pc over the summer  costing customers an extra £  a year     mr bentley said that the company had been forced to charge “honest customers” more to fund the cheaper offers  so now everyone pays the higher price  good job bg

       hmv are not drowning  but they’re doing a lot of waving at the moment  the beleaguered ‘entertainment retailer’ has recently tried to revamp their stores  removing loads of non selling cds and filling the space with gadgets and accessories instead     now  they’re having a bash at an on demand film service in an attempt to rake in some cash and not end up on the scrapheap     they’ve teamed up with filmflex  which it says here is a video on demand rental service joint venture between sony pictures television and the walt disney company  and they’ve come up with hmvon demand  which looks great  we’re sure they’ll thrive in what is a relatively niche but already overcrowded marketplace  hello to lovefilm  blinkbox  youtube and the oncoming netflix      hmv’s offering will be initially available via pcs  with plans to roll it out to other digital devices in the offing  they are also mumbling some stuff about downloading to own and  of course  ‘cloud based storage’    what do you reckon everyone – six months       guardian         
       if you’re a worker in an arcadia store  you’re probably not having the best of days  that’ll be mainly because your company’s owner  sir philip green has just announced that he’ll be closing down about   stores over the next three years  you all have a good day now     green has revealed the store closures through the national media along with a    drop in full year profits in the year to august  arcadia  who include top shop  bhs  burton  dorothy perkins and miss selfridge  still managed to make a fairly decent profit of £ m  but it’ll be curtains for some stores once their leases expire over the next three years     green  who is a government adviser and notorious tax scamp  is blaming the drop in profits on the warm autumn weather  you remember  when no one needed any clothes because we were all running around naked in the ‘autumn heat’     the arcadia boss said  “trading conditions remain extremely challenging  with style  quality and value at the top of our agenda and more important than ever  additionally  the warmest october and november on record have made autumn trading much tougher ” yeah  but the figures go up until august  you dick

         if you have a new iphone  s  you could well be having a bit of bother with it  it would appear that some users have noticed that it isn’t really working as a phone and that there’s repeated sim card failures     this is according to customer  help forums on the apple website   kinda flies in the face of those who say apple products ‘just work’     the sim problem seems to be affecting those running the new ios     on the iphone  s  leaving them staring at an error messages saying “invalid sim”     customers who have full bars are not able to connect to calls or receive texts  leaving one disgruntled customer feeling like they’d “purchased an ipod”     away from that  other customers are reporting ongoing issues with battery drain and wi fi connections not working as they should  one user on the help forum  writes      “so far i have had my iphone  s for   weeks and it worked flawlessly before the        after the update the signal was unstable  battery drain  an  issue   it has become  difficult to place call  call failed   and gives me invalid sim every few hours  i’ll be using  my old iphone    fortunately i didn’t update it with        i hope apple come out with a better update fix asap ”    the genius bar might be a little busy over the next few weeks

       hola amigos  it is i  len dastard – el bastardo  murderer of dreams  for those of you who do not know  i am a full time litigation executive and imaginary retired mexican wrestler  you doubt my story niños  you are brave        for our readers that have not been following this story  we brought you  this news  in july which television streaming website  tvcatchup   considered themselves to be victorious in a long running legal battle with uk broadcasters itv  channel   and channel       it was the broadcasters claim that tvcatchup were using material that they did not own the rights to  the response from tvcatchup was that they were only making temporary copies  then relaying free to air tv channels to users via computers and smartphones  of this material and that was a lawful use  in a recent ruling in the high court  mr justice floyd affirmed his earlier provisional ruling that the reproduction by the the creation of “rolling copies” of broadcasts in tvcatchups “memory buffers” and then on its members screens did not amount to a reproduction or copy of the broadcasts and tvcatchup     it might seem quite strange but uk copyright laws do not make “temporary copies” unlawful if the are “transient or incidental” to the whole works and are made in order to ensure the programme is technically broadcast with “no independent significance”   mr justice floyd based his provisional ruling in july on the fact that the section of stored video was approximately   to   seconds long     the only outstanding question in which mr justice floyd thought required further clarification from the european courts of justice was in relation to whether there has been a “communication to the public” which is in contravention to uk copyright laws  it is likely to be some time before this is all dealt with      got any issues that you would like len dastard to consider  get in touch – hello bitterwallet com        
      q   what does groupon  purveyor of emails full of temptingly cheap things you never knew you wanted have in common with tulisa  newest and youngest judge on the x factor   a   of course it’s not that they are both cheap   it’s because they have both been accused of malpractice by the advertising standards agency  asa   tulisa’s crime is to wave her crappy female boss tattoo at the cameras each week  when she has only gone and launched a new perfume named after her own arm  groupon  on the other hand  or arm  has been found guilty of a worse crime  pressuring people to have bigger boobs  it’s a tough job…    the culpable email in question  offering discounted cosmetic surgery  including breast enlargement  has been banned by the asa for “pressuring” consumers into hurriedly making potentially life changing decisions in just a few hours  the terms of the deal  as for many groupons  offered offered discounts of well over    on operations at a clinic in manchester if customers booked before midnight on the day the deal was sent out  the deal was sent out in may with surgery to take place by   november     the asa acted after receiving a complaint from a member of the public and on from the independent healthcare advisory service  claiming the groupon deal was irresponsible “because it encouraged recipients to hurry into a decision to purchase cosmetic surgery”     the asa pointed out that the marketing and ethical code run by the appropriately monikered british association for aesthetic plastic surgeons  baaps  prohibited ads that offered discounts linked to a deadline date for booking appointments “or other date linked incentives”  the practice also goes against the good practice guide of the general medical council     the asa went on to say that the “very limited time in which consumers had to buy the voucher pressured consumers into making a decision to  to all intents and purposes  purchase cosmetic surgery”     “we considered that the decision to undergo physically invasive procedures was one that required substantial consideration ” said the asa  “we noted consumers only had   hours in which to buy the voucher and because of that  we considered that consumers buying the voucher would have already financially and mentally committed themselves to going ahead with a procedure ”    this is not the first time groupon have been in the news this week  a poor baker in reading offered a deal to sell cupcakes for £    a box  generating a loss of £    per box  she was inundated with over     orders  which then wiped out her profits for the year  of course  no one made her offer the deal  but she still feels aggrieved that her marketing worked so well     but leaving cakes aside and going back to the baps  the asa concluded that the plastic surgery email promotion was irresponsible and banned the ad a mere six months after it had been and gone  the asa also banned a similar type of ad  one that referred to an ‘easy’ way to bigger breasts commissioned by the harley medical centre back  in    the advertiser commented that many women felt “renewed confidence and self esteem after cosmetic enhancement” and that there was not any implication that only big breasts could make someone happy  we beg to differ…     allegedly

         looking for a great deal on a portable gps navigator  there are many discounts being offered for black friday  though some prices are clearly better than others  it can be time consuming to scan sales flyers and determine the true standout deals on good navigators  to speed things along  we    ve done the homework for you  highlighting the best offers from major retailers       in scouring the ads  we noticed this year that the focus is on newer devices from top name brands  it used to be that there were gps units from smaller companies and electronics giants whose primary focus is not navigation  plus  many of the units with the most tempting prices were one  two  or even three generations old  this year  the pickings are much better  but shoppers are still facing some tough choices        as you look through the offers  and our  online ratings   it is key to determine your must have attributes  such as screen size  bluetooth connectivity  and traffic services  in scanning the ads  we see that models often offer lifetime maps  lifetime traffic  and sometimes even both  it is far more cost effective to purchase these features upfront than add them later  the real pitfall here is that some units without those options are likely to get the real head turning prices  it is your choice if you think the way you use the device will favor these services  we find them worthwhile   but the important thing is to know what you    re buying        in addition to discounts on portable devices  navigation app providers typically offers discounts for black friday and often again in december  if you    re a smart phone user looking for some extra guidance  hold out for reduced prices   navigon just announced  a temporary price drop in its latest apps  and the competitors are sure to follow        to compile the best deals list  we scoured major electronics retailers and deal sites  including many more than featured  of course  in this competitive market  more attractive deals may be available  but this provides an excellent start  we avoided refurb models  which were the focus for some online electronics retailers  a basic description is provided to help sift through the listing  but we recommend visiting the model pages at consumerreports org for ratings  features  and an explanation of performance  in some cases  multiple listings are included for a popular model  as stores may or may not be available locally  and online retailers may provide free shipping        many retailers are offering the same prices online as in the store  given that there are real risks that an individual store may run out of stock before you can negotiate your way to the shelves  consider buying online  it may better your chances  reduce stress  and potentially

       your  human capital  is just as important as your financial capital  in fact  it wouldn’t be a stretch to consider your human capital  your potential to become financially independent over time  more important than your net worth at any one particular time  over the past few weeks  i’ve been writing in depth about ways to boost your human capital through education  experience  and particular approaches to life decisions  this is the final article in the series      assuming the stock market provides a average return of   percent per year over the long term  the earlier you begin investing  the better you’ll be in the future  thanks to the way returns compound upon each other  starting a few years earlier could be the difference between retiring comfortably and struggling on a fixed income  of course  market performance in the future will have a great effect on your overall performance  but those who start early generally have a distinct advantage     the same theory applies to building your human capital  “start early” is generally the worst advice anyone can communicate because it’s impossible  until scientists invent a time machine  by the time someone says to you  “you should have started earlier ” you’ve missed your opportunity  if the message of starting early get across  however  the philosophy can be used for other situations and can be passed along to others  for example  while i didn’t save any of my income until i was in my late twenties  now knowing that it’s important to start early  i can help my potential children understand this importance from an earlier age      while many financial experts have succeeded in convincing people that it’s important to start saving and investing early to maximize the advantage offered by time  not many people talk about developing your human capital early      high school    by the time you finish your first year of high school  you should be well on your way to a financially successful life by exploring your talents and interests  taking part in extra curricular activities  and looking for opportunities to lead others  it sounds like a lot to ask of a fourteen year old kid  but if parents help steer children in the right direction without overloading them  these basic tenets will go far in helping the child develop into a successful adult     besides grade point averages and standardized test scores  the criteria that colleges use to evaluate potential students for acceptance  criteria which schools believe correlate to success  tend to be the same aspects that build human capital  those extra curricular activities  leadership roles  volunteer work  a diverse set of interests  and the ability to write an essay well all help a student convince an admissions board that he or she will thrive in the college environment      college    the college experience varies from person to person  you could gain a lot of maturity between ages   and    or you could spend four years wasting your life like so many students away from their parents for the first time  i wouldn’t be interested in a lifestyle that involves keeping my head in text books twenty four hours a day  seven days a week  so this is not what i’m suggesting      take advantage of the opportunities your college offers you   meet people  get involved in organizations  gain some experience in your field  and determine where your passion lies  college is the perfect time to awaken your soul to the possibilities before you find yourself in a   to   hour per week job     for most consumerism commentary readers  it’s too late to go back to being   years old or   years old to gain the human capital advantages they might have missed  the best one can do in this situation is to start right now     in addition to starting early  i’ve offered nine tips for  boosting your human capital   if you haven’t started already  start now  if you are already on your way to ensuring you are less likely to have financial problems in the future  consider doing more     every day  take just a few minutes to do one thing that enhances your human capital  it can be as easy as working out for twenty minutes —  good health helps ensure you’ll have an ability to earn income longer  — or updating your linkedin profile to make your listing more appealing to clients  you can take a step further  too  by meeting up with a colleague for a mentoring session  if you spend some time each day to think about what you can do to make yourself more valuable to the world  you’ll be putting yourself in a much better position in the future     photo   o com     the original version of this article   boost your human capital  start early   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      for my own finances  i’ve been a fan of  credit cards with cash back programs   some financial experts advise avoiding credit cards completely  even those cards that offer rewards like cash back  i’ve never been a fan of this approach — again  for my own finances — because i see a credit cards as just another tool for personal finance  a hammer is inherently neither good nor evil  it’s a tool that someone can use to fix a roof or to send another person to the hospital      for a large portion of consumers  credit cards cause trouble  that may not be a reason to avoid credit cards entirely  as consumers can learn how to use credit cards effectively  those of us who do believe we use cash back credit cards responsibly  paying bills in full every month  never paying interest  and buying only what we can afford  are relatively comfortable with the use of this tool  but even the best of us are subject to issuers’ traps     cash back credit card programs include traps that help issuers recover the cost of paying out benefits to their customers  while some traps can be avoided by managing finances closely  other traps take advantage of the psychological aspects of using plastic rather than cash  these traps can be more difficult to avoid  because consumers cannot control their subconscious tendencies  here are the cash back traps to avoid  if you can        credit card users spend more     the process of taking cash out of your wallet and handing that money to another person is a very deliberate activity  both physically and mentally  parting with cash has psychological ramifications  in most people  particularly those who best understand the value of having money saved  the act of giving the cash away triggers the same reaction as a painful activity  spending money and pain are linked in the brain     when you use credit cards  you add a buffer between your cash and the process of parting with it  spenders are less likely to hesitate and less likely to get that twinge of pain associated with handing over bills and coins  people familiar with computer science would call this a layer of abstraction  you’re controlling your money by using a representation of that money  not the cash itself  and that makes the process feel better  in addition  cards with a rewards program like cash back encourage higher spending  because that cash back is seen as a reward that can be maximized by spending more     avoid this by making a concerted effort to buy only what you could afford with cash at any time        late fees and interest negate any cash back benefits          if you have debt that you carry over from one month to the next  forget about cash back rewards programs  the interest you pay eliminates any benefit you may receive from the issuer  even if you manage to earn more cash back than interest you pay  consider that cash back credit cards often have higher interest rates than cards without any benefit program  while issuers advertise their cash back cards heavily  these cards should be used only by individuals who pay the bill in full every month  late fees also negate cash back  so never pay the bill late     accidents and emergencies happen  it only takes one to erase a year’s worth of cash back  if you use a cash back credit card  make sure you tell your issuer to withdraw your payment in full every month  and make sure you have enough money in your bank account to cover your credit card bill at the right time  have an  emergency fund  to cover yourself if you lose your job and can’t pay your credit card bill from your income        rotating categories and opt in requirements    over the past year  credit card issuers have increased their cash back percentages in an effort to win back customers who miss the   percent cash back on all purchases during reward programs’ heyday  this time  the higher benefits come with a catch  with tiered cash back  where some spending earns   percent  some earns   percent  and some earns   percent  issuers have become trickier  in many cases  the highest level of cash back is available only certain categories of spending  like gasoline or groceries  and the categories for which the companies make the cash back available rotate every three months  you have to pay attention if you want to keep track of how much cash back you should be earning     furthermore  some issuers require you to opt in to the highest cash back tier when the categories change every quarter  if you forget to contact the issuer  you don’t earn the higher percentage         incorrectly categorized purchases    this has happened to me as well as many consumerism commentary readers who have shared similar experiences  if you shop around to various gas stations to save money  and your card offers a higher cash back on gasoline purchases  you may not get your full cash back  while stations with brands like exxon mobile  sunoco  and shell are almost always categorized correctly  some of the smaller stations are not  issuers maintain a list of vendors and their categories for earning cash back  but smaller retailers often don’t make the list      if you’re in a period where gasoline purchases earn   percent and all other purchases earn   percent  if you shop at a less expensive  off brand gasoline station to save money  you may not receive the   percent cash back you should  issuers are inflexible  and customer service representatives will often say that if a retailer is not categorized correctly  there’s nothing they can do to credit you the full cash back         cash back can be difficult to claim    one of the first cash back cards i used on a regular basis was the citi dividend platinum select  with which i earned   percent cash back on all purchases  those were great days  but retrieving the cash i earned wasn’t a perfect process  after earning     i was able to request that citi send a check to the address on my account to cover my cash back  if i were to close my account before reaching the    cash back threshold  i would forfeit my cash back        cash back isn’t always cash back    file this under misleading advertising  if a credit card issuer is offering cash back  i expect to receive cash back at the rate that is advertised  like   percent  that should mean that for every    i spend  i earn    cash back  i don’t expect that the cash back be in the form of a gift card for a retailer  many issuers have improved their labeling of these programs  but some problems still exist      some issuers still use the term “cash back” when referring to a statement credit  if a credit card company credits your statement once a year with the cash back you earn for the previous twelve months  you haven’t earned cash back that you can use to deposit into savings  invest for the future  or buy yourself something additional  the issuer is keeping the cash back in its own hands by applying your cash back to your account  assuming your statement credit is     you can take    of your own cash that you would have applied towards your credit card bill and use that to increase your savings or buy something else  but the idea that you’re not receiving any real cash back from a cash back program is bothersome     additionally  if you close your account before your annual cash back credit  you might be forfeiting the portion of the benefit you earned        earning maximums and thresholds    with your favorite cash back card  or one that looks great on the surface  you may find that the fine print limits your cash back earning potential  some of the highest cash back rates  particularly those   percent rotating categories  are limited  the highest rates may only apply to the first      in spending — or less  the “biggest cash back credit card” that you may hear about in a competitor’s commercials is the  discover more card   you can earn    cash back in rotating categories each quarter  but the    is limited to the first    spent in that category  that means that the most you can earn from the accelerated tier is    each quarter  your spending in these categories may not exceed    over the course of three months  but if it does  you’ll be leaving money on the table     with some cards  like the  blue cash everyday from american express   you don’t earn a higher cash back percentage until your spending      in a year  purchases on the card in the highest tier after that point earn   percent  but until you reach that threshold  your purchases earn only       in the lower tier  you can earn      after reaching the threshold  but only      beforehand        changing terms    thanks to the  credit card act of     issuers have less flexibility to change your credit card terms without much notice  issuers do have options if they want to move customers from a great cash back program to a less impressive program  the most used option is replacing one card type with another  when citibank replaced the dividend platinum select mastercard with the dividend world mastercard  the cash back structure changed to be less beneficial for the customer  even customers who opted out of the switch  which citi approached as if it were mandatory for customers to accept  the cash back program was eventually reduced     the benefits spenders receive today can change at any time  credit card issuers react quickly to market forces  when one issuer offers a higher benefit  other issuers often respond within a week to remain competitive  the same reaction can happen on the opposite direction        some retailers are excluded    if your card earns   percent cash back at groceries stores  but you shop for groceries at costco  target  walmart  or some other store that’s not a pure grocery store or supermarket  you won’t earn that higher tier of cash back  in fact  some of the big warehouse stores are excluded from cash back programs altogether  some of these stores  often offering products at a discount compared to other stores  as well as small retailers who can’t afford to pay the higher interchange fees associated with some rewards cards  ban the use of cash back credit cards in their stores      shoppers may not be aware of this no cash back requirement until they have finished shopping  at the cashier  they are given the opportunity to buy all the products they collected from around the store with a card that offers no cash back  to pay for their items with cash  or leave the store without making their purchase  most shoppers will simply forgo the cash back and buy the products anyway  as that’s often a better option than considering the time spend in the store a waste and creating a necessity for shopping somewhere else         misleading conversion rates    as mentioned above  customers expect cash back programs to be straightforward  a   percent cash back rate should mean that every    earns    in pure cash  some issuers make the conversion more complicated that it should be  by saying you can redeem your cash back for full value only through retail gift cards  and more flexible forms of rewards would cost more  for example  a    pre paid debit card might cost    in cash back rewards     this conversion obfuscation is aided by issuers who use a point system rather than a straight cash back system  always be wary of point based benefits if your goal is to earn cash back  when credit cards use points  they add a layer of abstraction between your reward earnings and your cash back  and issuers can do whatever they like with those points  once you earn points  credit card companies can change their value relative to cash or change the price of the rewards for redemption     although some of the best maximizers can find ways to earn the most cash back from their spending  and some of the most focused work own a combination of credit cards to earn the highest cash back on all categories of spending at any one time  credit card issuers still have the upper hand  one mistake with a payment and you can throw away all the cash back you’ve earned in a year  you may misunderstand the complicated terms or forget to opt in to this quarter’s highest tier  or  just like a large portion of credit card users  you may spend more than you would otherwise in search of a relatively small reward  cash back credit cards are tools best used by those who have been trained to recognize these traps and fight the psychological impulses that allow spending to increase when using one of these tools     the original version of this article     cash back credit

      i’ve been tracking my net worth and keeping my finances updated in personal finance management software since july    i’ve done this mainly for myself  posting my finances online helps make the numbers real  i use these monthly reports to hold myself accountable  if i write publicly about spending more in a budget category than i should  i have no one to blame myself if  at the end of the following month  i still have the same problem  i would have to face the judgment of readers who see my lack of progress  by keeping my finances public  i try to hold my money related decisions to a high standard     over the past eight and a half years  this technique has helped me gain financial independence  combined with a thriving business  but this will be the final month i share my balances with this much detail  i’m moving into the next phase of my financial journey  and this requires taking back some of my willingness to bare all for an audience  i will still share quite a bit  more than most readers would expect  but the familiar balance sheet will be replaced with a different accountability measure     another reason to move away from posting a monthly balance sheet for accountability is the fact that the swings from month to month have more to do with stock market performance than day to day money management decisions  when i had very little money invested and my expenses were close to my income  every decision i made could have a strong effect on my finances  that is not the case today  just like my need for tracking every cent has been relinquished as my budget began to allow more freedom  my daily spending has a smaller effect than decisions pertaining to the larger picture  like my investment portfolio allocation and diversification  i’ll be writing more about my investment choices in the future     in october  my investments recovered  this contributed to an increase in my net worth  continue reading to see the numbers                note that i took my business accounts out of this report a few months ago  business income was healthy again in october  but that’s not reflected in these numbers     if you’ve been following consumerism commentary  you should recognize the different lines included in my balance sheet  “cash in banks” includes all the checking and savings accounts i own  mostly  high yield savings accounts   i added a new savings account in october  and it wasn’t exactly what i wanted to do  i needed a signature guarantee in person  a service banks and brokerages often provide  i walked into my local wells fargo branch  but the representative had no idea what i was asking for  the next closest bank location was a chase branch  so i walked in to ask whether they could provide a signature guarantee      at chase  the representative knew what i was asking for and was able to provide the signature guarantee for free — but only for chase customers  despite the proximity to  bank transfer day   i opened a new account at chase with a    cash deposit  in order for this checking account to remain free  i needed to initiate a    per month direct deposit or maintain a      balance  i covered both bases      i’m not happy with the idea of adding yet another bank account  but i’ve also spent some time during the past few months canceling many of the savings accounts i’ve opened over the past few years as tests for writing reviews on consumerism commentary  i closed or zeroed out my hsbc advance account  ally bank accounts  everbank accounts  sallie mae account  discover bank account  and zions bank account  i’ll be canceling more accounts as i continue to  simplify my finances      my investments line includes a few accounts for stock trading  mostly unused  as well as an individual brokerage account at vanguard  my plan for this month is to look into moving my investments around so this account includes the most tax efficient investments  i’d rather have tax free investments in this account to reduce my tax liability  while leaving the less tax efficient investments in retirement accounts like   k s and iras     those   k  plans and iras are included in the retirement line in the above balance sheet  for the honda civic line  i’ve just been reducing the value of my car by    every month  this may be something i shouldn’t include in the report  but for a while  this was my most valuable asset  and since i could sell my car in an emergency  i thought it might be worthwhile to track  i occasionally check the car’s value in edmunds or kelley blue book  i don’t see selling this car until it costs more to maintain than it is worth  i’ve put very little money into the honda civic besides regular maintenance     the amount in my credit cards category is paid off every month  i’ve been using primarily a  chase continental airlines onepass plus card   and i’ve used the miles earned for upgrades  with all the traveling i’ve done this year  i”m very close to earning “silver” elite onepass status in continental’s  and united’s  frequent flyer program  but i might end the year without crossing the threshold of     elite qualification miles   with the onepass plus card  the miles you earn for every purchase do not help you qualify for a higher frequent flyer tier      as i mentioned above  my plan for november is to simplify my finances by reducing the number of open accounts  next month  i’ll report november’s progress and review my finances as of the end of the month  but i’ll be changing the format  the monthly financial update is an integral part of this website  so i will find a way to continue this tradition despite the change of relevance     the original version of this article   personal balance sheet  october                   is copyrighted by

      i’ve avoided writing about black friday this year  in the community i follow  promoting the day after thanksgiving for shopping has gotten completely out of hand  i wrote an article for pc world a few years ago   the insider’s guide to black friday bargains   where the tips are still relevant for today’s shoppers  i’m not going to write a new article every year about how to find the best black friday deals     as if black friday weren’t enough of a marketing scheme  a few years ago consumers were blessed to receive cyber monday  yet another day of hype encouraging people to buy more  i’m not always anti consumerism  but i just find every year’s increased holiday sale hype  designed as a last ditch  end of year effort to make up for poor sales since january    annoying  doorbusters  bait and switch  and worst of all  and  crazed wal mart shoppers who are willing to kill others  just to be first to grab some sale item that will be worth a tiny portion of its sale price in five months  make me embarrassed to be an american consumer      the opposite approach is to put faith in  buy nothing day   the message of buy nothing day is good  but like any temporary boycott  it just time shifts spending  what you don’t spend on the day after thanksgiving you’ll likely spend the next day  and if a sale expires  you’ll spend more     the worst thing to come out of the holiday hype is “small business saturday ”  let’s just stop naming the days following thanksgiving  also known as turkey thursday   this is american express’s effort to get consumers to patronize local stores in favor of national chains  on the surface  this isn’t a bad idea  support business owners in the community by visiting smaller retail establishments who otherwise have a difficult time competing with large box stores like best buy  wal mart  target  and home depot  your neighborhood appliance or hardware store generally charge more money for the same products offered by national chains because small stores have little leverage to negotiate with wholesalers  working with a small business based in the community you live  having a friendly face who can help answer your questions  and building a relationship with a business owner might be strong enough reasons to settle for a higher priced item     this is coming from american express  many small business owners simply can’t afford to accept payments using american express cards  it costs more money for a retailer to accept most american express cards than most visa or mastercard credit cards  when you do use your american express cards at a small business  you are not helping the store as much as you would if you were to pay with cash  american express interchange fees can take an unhealthy bite out of a small business’s profits  also  unlike visa and mastercard  who generally split merchant fees with banks that issue their cards  american express cards are generally not issued by third parties  and the company keeps the entire interchange fee     the “small business saturday” campaign was not created for the good of the overall economy  american express offers this message  “the  nd annual small business saturday® is a day dedicated to supporting small businesses on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year ” but the day supports american express  which is not a small business  through this campaign  american express is offering small businesses that accept their cards to prominently display an advertisement that offers a    credit to any customer who uses an american express card to purchase items totaling    or more at the location  there is little in this campaign other than self interest and self promotion on american express’s part     is this bad  it’s hard to say  if you want to do your part to support local businesses that are in danger of closing partly due to the high prices credit card companies charge  shop there but pay cash  forget about the    cash back or less you can earn  paid for by the small business owners  the    credit in the offer doesn’t support small businesses because this isn’t extra money that can be used to purchase more in a store  it’s a statement credit  designed to thank card holders for using american express and requiring retailers that accept the cards to pay more to amex through fees     american express is  thanks to capitalism  allowed to promote almost anything it likes in order to increase profit  that’s how corporations compete  build value for shareholders  and help upper middle class households stay upper middle class and wealthy households increase their wealth  the company reports that small businesses saw an increase in sales due to last year’s small business saturday campaign  but note that they didn’t see the same large increase in profits   look past the marketing messages at who is most benefiting from this campaign     when the sun goes supernova and engulfs the earth  marketers will

       this is a guest article by jon the saver  a personal finance blogger at  free money wisdom    his mission is to spread financial wisdom and help people get their financial lives under control   in his down time he loves a mean game of scrabble and spending quality time with his fiancee      i’m probably the only personal financial blogger who works in the construction industry   it may sound like a strange combination  but it actually makes sense   there are so many financial aspects to construction  it blows my mind     to give you some background  i currently work for a fortune   general contractor in the heavy civil industry   we work on large scale projects like highways  bridges  and power plants   i graduated college with a degree in construction management and love what i do   how many people do you know can say that   well  i can and i’m proud of it   i love the ability to go out on a project site and then be able to come back indoors   i would hate cubicle life and feel like i’m wired for construction      to say that the construction industry has revolutionized my personal finances is pretty bold   as bold as it may be  it’s true   i have always had big picture personal finance principles as my foundation  but construction has really taught me a lot about personal finance  some of it from studying long hours in college and some of it from getting my work boots dirty in the field     let’s dig our boots in and explore this revolution        execution without planning will result in failure    you can try to execute  but if you don’t have proper planning  it’s doomed to fail   in construction this happens when someone doesn’t do his job and forgets to plan accordingly   this could be as simple as a missing checklist or as serious as not ordering enough concrete   another big one is planning for safety   you never want injuries on your job site   if you don’t engineer out the risks of an operation  how can you be confident in your execution      effect on finances   this is everything from proper retirement planning to education on personal finances   i mean  why do you read this blog  probably because you want to plan for your future   planning is everything   if you have a good plan  you’re destined for success            rule applies to your finances    i’m a huge believer in the     rule  also known as  the pareto principle    i first heard of this rule from a professor in college   the basic idea is that    of your results come from    of your work   more and more i’m finding this to be true  there are only a handful of decisions that are really going to affect you on a construction job   things like a concrete pour are extremely critical  whereas a meeting on the door paint may be pushed to another week       effect on finances   very few of your decisions will really have a big effect on your finances   i would say the top two decisions that fall into the     rule are living a debt free life and saving   to   percent of your income for retirement   now  there are others  but those two come to mind right now   take the     rule and apply it to your financial life  you might even start to feel less stressed        where are you headed without a schedule     a construction project is   percent schedule driven   without an organized schedule  how will you know what will be happening the next week   how will you know when to mobilize big equipment   these issues are solved by keeping an in depth schedule and maintaining it   most of our meetings on a job site are schedule related  and there is good reason for that      effect on finances   your retirement timeline will determine what your savings goals and personal schedule looks like   knowing this timeline will also tell you what percentages you want to be in various asset classes for stocks and bonds   for example  a   year old should be invested in   percent bonds and   percent stocks   now  take a   year old   this person would want to be invested in   percent bonds and   percent stocks   knowing your schedule has a huge impact on your investment decisions        know your costs    on a construction project  knowing your costs will make or break your bottom line   everything down to the office supplies need to be accounted for   not only is this a good practice for keeping good records  but it ensures that you get paid by the owner   without a record of your costs  your boat is going to sink and sink fast      effect on finances   when you relate this concept to your finances  this means keeping track of all expenses and where your money is going   knowing where your money is going is crucial to saving effectively and ensuring you don’t fall into the trap of debt   if you don’t know where to start for tracking your costs  i recommend  mint com         protect your assets    as a general contractor  we own much of our heavy equipment  everything from bulldozers to mobile cranes   part of the responsibility of owning these pieces of equipment is to protect our assets   we maintain this equipment and always keep the moving parts up to date   a broken bulldozer is useless in the eyes of a general contractor      effect on finances   this one is more human related   part of personal finances is  keeping your body and mind healthy  so you can enjoy your retirement or enjoy your hard earned money now   i’m always trying to explain this to people   your body is your greatest asset   without it  you’re in for some serious repercussions   eat healthy and exercise on a weekly basis   you want to enjoy your “glory years” right     who knew that construction had so many lessons that you could apply to personal finances   i hope you enjoyed this post   now you know it’s not so crazy to be in construction and love personal finance     photo   bucklava     the original version of this article   construction revolutionized my finances   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if

      a few years ago  netflix and wal mart allegedly entered an agreement where wal mart agreed to exist the dvd rental business and promote netflix’s service and netflix would not sell new dvds to compete with wal mart  a group of netflix customers have banded together to enter a class action anti trust lawsuit against the two companies for this practice  which allegedly allowed netflix to gain dominance and raise customers’ fees     wal mart has agreed to settle the lawsuit  the company will pay a settlement fee of         with some of the proceeds going to affected customers  netflix  on the other hand  has not yet stopped fighting the lawsuit       you are included in the wal mart settlement class if you live in the united states or puerto rico and you paid a subscription fee to netflix to rent dvds online anytime from may      through september       any customer who had only a free netflix trial does not qualify  you may receive a dollar or two from this settlement  but in order to receive your benefit  you must  file a claim   you can receive the payment in cash or a gift card     the    million from wal mart will be divided between lawyers  who will receive up to    of the payment plus additional costs of up to      million  administration expenses  and fees to class representatives at      a piece  the remainder will be divided equally between all settlement class members who file a claim  to get an idea of how many customers might need to split an estimated    million  netflix had   million customers in the united states at the end of september     netflix is still fighting the lawsuit  they might eventually settle  and if they do  customers who would qualify for benefits include any person or entity in the united states that paid a subscription fee to netflix anytime from may      to september       if there are benefits to receive  class members will not need to take any action  any class members who would like to excise themselves from the lawsuit or potential settlement and reserve the right to sue netflix regarding this issue will need to mail a letter to opt out     the official website for the netflix wal mart class action lawsuit regarding dvd sales is onlinedvdclass com     the original version of this article   netflix wal mart class action lawsuit   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      american express has always been great in varying their credit card offers to business owners   whether a business owner’s priority is travel accommodations  spending power or saving money  there’s a credit or charge card designed to help out    the  trueearnings business card from costco and american express  fits into the saving money category  as it’s the only business card around offering    cash back on gasoline purchases        all business owners of the trueearnings business card from costco and american express will receive a    introductory apr for six months  after the introductory period  the interest rate reverts to a standard apr of      variable   the cash advance apr is      variable and the default apr is a pricey      variable so avoid cash advances and pay bills on time to prevent default     the trueearnings® business card’s primary feature is cash back  and the card offers competitive cash back rates  listed below  cardholders will not be subject to cash back limits  and the cash earned never expires            for annual gasoline purchases of up to          thereafter         for restaurants and travel        everywhere else  including costco        every business is entitled to additional perks and benefits as owners of an american express business credit cards  here are some of the noteworthy benefits        no annual fee with your paid costco membership     save up to    automatically on business expenses from fedex  hertz  and more with open savings     assistance with emergency card replacement  check cashing  and hotel check in        few business credit cards offer the full package  these tend to be big money makers for card issuers  whether through a high interest rate or annual fee  the  trueearnings business card from costco and american express  seems to be one of the few business cards offering a solid rewards program with a low apr  and  possibly most importantly  no annual fee     consider enhancing your business by signing up for the trueearnings® business card from costco and american express today            the original version of this article   trueearnings business card from costco and american express review   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      last week  a photograph by andreas gurksy   rhein ii   was sold at auction for        to an anonymous buyer  the record breaking sale allowed gursky to reclaim fame as the artist whose work has claimed the highest price paid for a photograph  this auction was a secondary market sale  as in most art auctions commanding high prices and press attention  the artist sees little if any financial benefit     what do you think of the image  is it art  is it art you would consider to be worth    million     million          it wasn’t this lowly jpeg that was sold  seeing the print — considered a very important part of the art of photography — is an experience in itself  to see this work in person  you would be gazing at a print eight feet by twelve feet  even today’s relatively advanced digital cameras  devices used by professional wedding photographers and amateurs like me around the world  wouldn’t be able to produce a print that size with quality and resolution  this image was most likely produced with a large format camera using analog film      there’s only one way to determine the value of a work of art  offer it to a wide audience of potential art buys and determine what at least one of them would be willing to pay to take it home  looking beyond the simple supply and demand answer  any piece of art is able to fetch a certain price at auction due to only a few factors  some aspects moving a price aren’t related to the specific piece of art as much as the artist         buyers look for a works by photographers who have a history of creating art in demand by galleries and collectors     photographers who were trained by other artists who have been successful are also rewarded for their potential     in most cases  buyers believe that the art will be worth more in the future  and view the purchase as an investment        some reasons behind a price relate to the process of creating the art  it’s only recently that photography has become accepted as art  color photography even more recently  and many artists still consider photographs with digital manipulation in editing software like photoshop not art at all  photography still has a long way to go before it’s fully accepted alongside oil painting and sculpture as art  that’s reflected in value as well  while this    million price for  rhein ii  is a nice sum  it falls short of the  running man i  sculpture by alberto giacometti  which  fetched a sale price of      million  recently      the fact that this image was captured using a large format camera  a process that is significantly more involved than pointing and shooting  helps to add to the value  but many photographers  particularly landscape artists and architectural photographers  still use large format cameras  the type of camera cannot be the sole reason driving the value of art  but it is an important factor when an artist is striving for the best quality possible      although this image looks simple  a lot of planning went into its creation  artists carefully plan the time and place  bring the right equipment  and without a digital camera  do not have the luxury of taking a flurry of snapshots to choose the best image of one hundred on a memory card  often  a work of art is part of a series or a study on a particular theme  and in the case of  rhein ii   the photograph falls within a series about the river in germany     ken rockwell  a respected but divisive photographer who has one of the most popular websites about the art  has this to say about the photograph      it is valuable because it is art  not just a photo  rules are worthless  if  gurksy  was just a photographer instead of an artist  he would have been crippled by the nonexistent “rule of thirds” myth  and put the horizon someplace else  in his case  the horizon slams right through the middle  which adds to the power by giving a sense of unease  our minds ask “what’s up with this  this is so barren and empty  where is this place ”    likewise  if it’s not captured on film  it is not art  artists create art  not photographers  artists may choose to work in photography  but being an artist is what matters above all…    if shot with a digital nikon or canon like amateur photographers  it would not have been art  if he used a zoom lens or many modern prime lenses  their distortion would have subtly curved the lines  weakening and destroying the artist’s work        ken doesn’t point out that gursky did digitally manipulate the image after making the capture  the view portrayed by the image above doesn’t exist in nature  gursky removed people  dogs  and a building from the captured image to create the art     nevertheless  the image is so simple that it looks like something anyone can capture  standing beside any river in the world on any dreary day  one nature of art is the ability to stir emotions in a spectator  even if that emotion is anger in response to a sale price  frustration that an image of mostly straight lines and solid colors can be considered art  jealousy that another photographer’s images wouldn’t fetch such a price  confusion about why it’s acceptable for some digitally manipulated images to be considered art while others aren’t  or questioning whether the image is art at all     this describes the industry reaction to the sale  the luminous landscape forums are  buzzing with comments  about this sale and the image from professional photographers — mostly commercial photographers who dabble with artistic photography  specializing in medium and large format cameras      why spend so much money on art     with so many problems in the world  why spend    million on one piece of art rather than using that money to build a school or feed starving children  this is a fair question to ask  at this high level of sophisticated art acquisition  there is a big emphasis on the investment aspect of art  with the photographer still living and with photographic art still being rare compared to other visual art methods  there is a good possibility of the value of this work increasing over the very long term      although it’s common to question the intent of purchasing a work of art for    million  investors who dedicate the same amount of money to a company to become an owner of that company usually won’t face the same questions about the virtue of their investment  both buying art and buying a company are capitalistic endeavors  but while the value of a company can be easily justified by looking at a set of financial reports  the art is more difficult to rationalize  regardless of the reasons  the value of a company or a work of art is whatever someone is willing to pay     by investing in art  it sends a signal that art  in general  is worth society’s attention  art is an important part of civilized society  and both reacts to and inspires thought that drives a society forward     photo  andreas gursky christie’s images  ltd

      you’ll never reach the top level in abraham maslow’s hierarchy of needs  self actualization  if you concern yourself with your possessions  if you focus on acquiring gadgets  showering your children with toys  or achieving other materialistic pursuits  if you do so while neglecting the pursuit of including satisfying experiences in your life  you can never reach your full potential      even thinking about experiences beyond base needs is a luxury when abiding by maslow’s theory  because pursuing fulfilling experiences requires discretionary income or available cash  anyone who hasn’t been able to meet the lower level requirements in the hierarchy may need to devote all resources to health and safety  for those of us in the developed world who have benefited from a society that allows successful people to do as they choose with their financial surplus  we often face questions about how to spend that money with an eye towards increasing happiness      as i’ve found myself in a more comfortable financial situation over the last decade — and that comfort comes from an increased income and an ability to save for the future without sacrificing too much of my present — i’ve begun trying to find more ways to use surplus income  after meeting savings goals  to enjoy my life today  financial writers often get caught up with the idea that people need to save as much money as possible for the future  but once there is some comfort with planning  there has to be an opportunity to enjoy life today     once my finances were on a solid path  i decided i was comfortable increasing today’s expenses  the gateway for me was most likely moving into a new apartment  if my only income came from my day job  i might not have been able to comfortably move from a small apartment to a nicer  larger apartment without making sacrifices somewhere else  by moving into the newer apartment  i recognized that my income stream outside of my day job would be fairly steady  and that i had an emergency fund for back up in the event of a disaster  i also accumulated things  with my day job  i was able to afford cable again  but with extra income  i was able to justify high definition service and a new  high definition television      i was able to afford to buy cameras  lenses  and other photography equipment  several of which i still purchased used to save money   and to explore this hobby further  this gets into the topic at hand  experiences vs  things  while photography equipment consists of things  they are items that allow me to explore a hobby — or possibly a future business — and create experiences for myself  i attended classes at the local arts council to further develop my skills     a study from   building on prior research about materialism explains that using money to acquire experiences increases long term happiness than using money to acquire objects  here are some of the results      as anticipated  respondents asked to evaluate an experiential purchase indicated that it made them happier than did those asked to evaluate a material purchase  respondents also indicated that experiential purchases were better financial investments than material purchases  participants indicated that  compared with material purchases  experiential purchases made them happier  contributed more to their happiness in life  and represented money better spent  respondents were also less inclined to say that the money spent on experiences could have been better spent elsewhere than the money spent on material possessions       the authors of the   study also offer suggestions for the causes of these results  why do experiential purchases result in happiness more than material purchases         experiences are more open to positive reinterpretation   as time passes  view of history becomes rosier      experiences are more central to one’s identity   we are the sum of our experiences  people rarely identify with the items they’ve collected around their house as much as they identify with experiences like travel  operating their own business  and spending time with family      experiences have greater social value   people like sharing and talking about their experiences  and this type of discussion fosters better relationships than talking about possessions        a follow up study in   goes further to explain why experiences are more satisfying  this study found that it was easy to compare a purchased item  such as a high definition television  with other similar items at the time of purchase and looking back  when comparing experiences  such as a family trip to disney world  it’s much more difficult to make effective comparisons  also  consumers are more likely to try to get the best deal when shopping for items with a strong field of comparable items but are more likely to  satisfice  when deciding to purchase an experience  among other reasons  the researchers also determined that consumers are more likely to compare their material purchases with others’ purchases while have a difficult time doing the same for experiential purchases     you may be looking forward to the holidays  wondering what type of gifts would make your family and friends happiest  you can always play to the utilitarian point of view by purchasing gifts that the recipient might need  but to have the greatest impact  consider finding a way to offer an experience that everyone would enjoy  the benefits might not be immediate  but an experience could create memories that outshine this year’s  hot christmas toy  or latest apple product for years to come     some experiential holiday gifts come to mind         a weekend getaway   spend the weekend in a nearby city to save on transportation costs  and explore the town  this is something i did this past weekend in philadelphia  it wasn’t a gift  but i am sure my girlfriend and i are going to remember our scary experience at the eastern state penitentiary for the rest of our lives      dinner and a broadway show   good food and entertainment combine to make lasting memories that enhance happiness  for those who attend broadway shows more than once a year  find a way to make it more memorable  perhaps with a backstage tour  vip seating  or meeting the cast      long distance travel   it’s often less expensive to travel outside of the country than to travel across  within the united states  there are almost endless opportunities for unique travel experiences as well  i will always remember the time i spent exploring death valley with my family      an exciting activity   my girlfriend seems interested in skydiving and hot air ballooning  i’m not a big fan of either of these activities because i would like to  live  for a long time  but i know these are activities that would make her happy if she were to live to tell me about them        consider leaving behind the material this holiday season and increasing someone’s long term happiness by engaging in an activity or experience the memory of which will last a lifetime and become more favorable as time passes     photo   comedynose    journal of

       it’s easy to focus on the personal policies that help improve your net worth immediately  saving money  investing thoughtfully  and earning income affect your bottom line immediately  this view can be shortsighted occasionally  focusing effort on your  personal human capital  can have a greater affect on your net worth over the course of the rest of your life  there are certain things anyone can do to improve the probability of being financially secure in the future  focusing on your health can ensure you’ll have many income earning years in the future      there is  much about your finances you can control   but some circumstances  while they can be prepared for  are difficult to predict  the same is true about health  the best anyone can do is take good care of his mind and body to reduce the chance that health will be a major concern       get health insurance   if you do not have a job that offers group health insurance and do not have access through a family member  finding coverage can be expensive  when i left my corporate job last year  i investigated prices for individual health coverage in new jersey  and coverage similar to what i had at the company cost over one thousand dollars a month  basic coverage was significantly less  but the benefits were not as comprehensive as what i had with my prior hmo plan  when i left the job  i had access to cobra coverage  which extended the same coverage i had  but the premiums were no longer subsidized  the monthly fee was expensive  but manageable       don’t make any insurance payment mistakes   if you are paying for health insurance coverage on your own  create an automated payment plan  one missed payment can give the health insurance company cause to cancel your coverage      reduce your intake of unhealthy food   you don’t have to be a health fanatic  you can make some easy changes to your diet that should improve your health over the long term  for the most part  i no longer drink soda  opting for water instead  i don’t consider myself a health expert  and there are still many improvements to my diet that could result in increased health  but my plan for now is to be more conscious about the food i eat       stay active   if you’re not an athlete  there’s no need to undertake a massive campaign for exercise  if you have a job that keeps you sitting at a desk for most of the day  though  consider compensating for a sedentary lifestyle by taking some time to keep your muscles active  i  joined a gym recently  and i’m still looking to find a routine that works for me  i have lost some weight and i feel healthier in general  the challenge is maintaining this with a work and travel schedule that keeps me busy  making it difficult for me to set aside regular time     i don’t always recommend joining a gym  though  some people may find the environment motivating  but for others  it will cost less money in the long run to  exercise independently  without a monthly fee  the most important aspect is to stay active  regardless of how it’s accomplished  even if you find the best way for you to stay active is to join a gym  spending that money now to stay in shape could pay off in the future through improved health      get good sleep  quality and quantity   i combined a good mattress  good sheets  and good pillows and was halfway towards improving my sleep  throughout my life  i had never really achieved quality sleep  as far back as middle school  i often stayed up late at night computer programming and running a bulletin board system  this lasted throughout high school  in college  i spent my days in class  studying  and practicing  while spending many nights designing and maintaining websites  later on  my time outside of my day jobs was also spent working on websites  all of this left very little time for sleep  and the sleep i did get wasn’t comfortable     i didn’t have to spend a lot of money to fix this problem  finding the right mattress took some time  but i’m satisfied with the one i have now  i discovered that “memory foam” pillows don’t bother my neck and back as other pillows  someone introduced me to cotton jersey knit sheets  and i find these much more comfortable than other cotton or satin sheets  once i was able to combine this with seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night  i wake up refreshed and i can get through everyday without becoming exhausted     from  forbes       talking of getting a good night’s sleep — critical for boosting memory — the key is to let melatonin do its trick  that’s a versatile hormone produced by the brain  it synchronizes the biological clock  regulates sleep and is a powerful antioxidant  scientists believe it strengthens the immune system and has a strong link to preventing depression  cardiovascular disease  some cancers and sexual dysfunction       visit your doctor and dentist   just having insurance isn’t enough  visit the doctor twice a year for check ups and get any tests appropriate for your age  the same applies to the dentist  when i was in college  i don’t think i visited a dentist once  i returned to my home state of new jersey several months after graduating to work at my new job  and after receiving insurance  i made my first appointment with a dentist in years  it was a good thing my teeth and gums weren’t in worse shape than they were  flossing and brushing keeps gums healthy  and healthy gums help increase the chance of maintaining the health of the rest of your body      quit smoking  or don’t start    while everyone seems to have an anecdote to share about a two pack a day smoker who lived beyond   years  this isn’t the norm  you can improve your health — and your short term finances — by quitting smoking  you’ll save money today  you’ll be healthier so that you can continue earning money  and you’ll feel healthier  quitting may not b an easy feat  but all ex smokers i know are happy they made the decision      manage your stress   i’ve never been more stressed in my life than i have been as a business owner  i’ve made my way through my life until this point generally avoiding stress  not letting myself get too emotionally involved in my work  it’s different when it’s my own business  and dealing stress has been difficult for me  i use relaxation techniques to help deal with stress  particularly when i know the situations that cause stress can’t be avoided      staying healthy can reduce your downtime at work and help you make the most of your income earning years  your health might help you extend those years  as well  while i get the impression that the media emphasize health too much  to the point at which unhealthy individuals as marginalized  in order to be healthy  you don’t need to look like an actor or athlete  but paying attention to these few core health principles can be worthwhile for anyone interested in being financially secure  a good attitude towards health and a few healthy habits

      i’m an accidental entrepreneur      i never quite fit in with big hierarchical systems  like public education  as a teacher  and corporations  getting things done  particularly accomplishing various things the way i wanted to accomplish them  has always been a struggle for me in these structures  i knew from the day i started working at a corporation after leaving a small non profit arts agency that i would never quite  find my bliss  or even thrive in that type of environment  i remember thinking that my first job  an administrative type of position  didn’t add any value to the world  the position only existed from a pure corporate need  not a societal need  if the corporation weren’t as big as it was  my job function would be unnecessary     there were other options for me to consider such as owning an independent school of some type or creating an arts foundation  but those goals required two things i did not have at the time  money and experience  so i stuck it out in the corporation for more years than i would have liked  and i put energy into hobbies like writing and blogging     my hobby became a business over time  and you can see this in its incarnation as  consumerism commentary   while all i was doing initially was learning how to become the  chief financial officer of my own life   i became the ceo of a company that was helping me attain that first goal  being a ceo has been outside of my comfort zone  and i’ve made a number of mistakes over the last few years  the experience has been one of growth for me  and i believe i’ll eventually get the hang of running a business and accepting the fact that i am an entrepreneur     in the past  the word “entrepreneur” has always been associated with a negative connotation for me  i viewed people who called themselves entrepreneurs as people who knew exactly what to say to manipulate others into relationships  they’re savvy  smooth  and disingenuous  they see all communication and relationship building with a purpose in mind — building their own business and growing wealth for themselves     now that i’ve become what other people often call an entrepreneur  i’m dealing with this cognitive dissonance  what other choice did i have  though  to work for myself  i was out of place in formally structured work environments  particularly where i wasn’t free to take whatever approach to my work i wanted  when i wanted  i may have misjudged entrepreneurship  but i still see this type of posturing in my daily experiences operating consumerism commentary     to add another layer to the idea of entrepreneurship  with the employment market still very much in favor of employers  the trend in financial advisory media towards working for oneself has increased in volume — in both senses  quantity and amplitude  i do agree that by finding a way to work for yourself removes employers from the picture  giving you much more control over your financial destiny   a portion of that control just moves from an employer to potential clients or customers  however   a typical advice based article attempts to convince all corporate drones to leave their unfulfilling job and start their own businesses      taken to the extreme  a nation of business owners wouldn’t work  this advice  however  might inspire a small portion of readers to crash through their psychological barriers and find a way to add value directly  not everyone will be a successful entrepreneur      i think there are certain personality traits that lend themselves to being a great business owner  first from a myers briggs perspective  where the best business owners likely have a profile of “entj ”  after some quick research  i’m right on the money with this assessment  the entj type is often called  the executive  type   for contrast  i am an “infp ”        extraversion   dealing with business issues is much easier for someone on the extraversion side of the first dimension  this would be someone who feels energized after dealing with people  i find certain aspects of dealing with people on a business level very draining  though i am comfortable being among large groups of people  i am slightly on the introversion side of this dimension  but a myers briggs step ii assessment reveals that this is slightly different from my core personality  which would call for a stronger introversion score      judging   while my personality traits register on the feeling side of this dimension  a judging tendency helps people lend themselves towards the same working structures i’ve never been comfortable with  the same trait that encourages the hierarchical approach to business  helpful when working in school systems and large corporations  is also beneficial to running a business  i’ve also been uncomfortable judging the sincerity of people i’ve worked with in the past  many of my mistakes i alluded to above are related to my impressions of people      self motivation   without a boss providing guidance and deadlines  the responsibility for performing rests only with the business owner  i find that motivation is much easier when you own the process  like students who perform better in college when they pay their own tuition  an entrepreneur’s business is all about that one person  the ability to design a business based around something you’re passionate about or particularly skilled at will infuse motivation into many people who’ve struggled with this in other employment settings      forward looking and big picture   anyone who is content with repetitive tasks or would prefer to perform a job by following a step by step guide may not be best suited for a life of entrepreneurialism  running your own business requires looking beyond the next step  it involves always considering the big picture and the ability to define goals  not everyone is suited for this level of thinking      determination   from the outside  determination can look like stupidity  being determined in the face of critics  refusing to give up regardless of what someone else might think of your abilities or your business’s potential is essential to becoming successful  not only that  but considering businesses often fail  being serious about working for yourself requires the ability to brush off the failures and use them as an opportunity to learn about the business and about yourself         a careless attitude towards money   many entrepreneurs have succeeded because they have had the financial means to go after their dreams  if you’re already wealthy  you can stand to take some risks with your business  someone less established financially would find it much more difficult to justify the risks  for a business like mine  there was not much financial risk at the beginning  i did  however  spend almost all of my waking and some of my sleeping hours to finding a path to success  to the dismay of those who sought to spend more time with me     the concentration on my own business most likely affected  though probably in a small way  my ability to focus on and care about my day job  i may have missed out on promotions because i wasn’t going beyond my job scope  i was using my own time to build a business  in the end  it was the right decision for me  but it could have easily gone another way  i would have ended up with a continued low salary and no income on the side  from a truly financial perspective  starting a business can be a careless risk  good entrepreneurs accept this or ignore this  or are just unaware of this            obsessive compulsive   with the biography of steven jobs due out soon  a lot of media attention has surrounded his attitude  particularly his obsessiveness  in the book  jobs is described as not settling for anything less than perfection all the time  and perfection in his opinion could rarely be defined before him  he would know it when he were to see it     from a design perspective  this has shown to be immensely perspective  as malcolm gladwell  said in his coverage of the biography   “the great accomplishment of jobs’s life is how effectively he put his idiosyncrasies—his petulance  his narcissism  and his rudeness—in the service of perfection ”           generalist   today’s economy seems to appreciate specialists over generalists  but i see the opposite as being the better approach to a fulfilling life — and generalism is an approach particularly suited for entrepreneurship  large companies have the need for specialists  people who are very good  excellent  or best in the world at doing one particular thing  this can be a very narrow skill  an entrepreneur who starts a company from the ground up  particularly with limited resources at the beginning  needs to be able to handle many different types of tasks and goals  at the same time  while holding herself to a very high standard     as the business grows  there can be adjustments  when struggling and to build their business  the founders of yahoo brought in a ceo from the outside because running the company at a certain level required skills the founders couldn’t quite meet on their own  during the start up phase  however  the entrepreneurs needed to find a way to tackle all the hard tasks  in this respect  being a jack of all trades  master of none is the best approach for an entrepreneur  provided that this particular jack is a very skilled jack in all trades           leaving traditional employment structures behind is not for everyone  and the advice we often see telling everyone to quit their job and start a business can be largely ignored  if you aren’t predisposed towards at least a few of these personality traits  success will be very difficult  if  however  you don’t have these traits in your system  you can train yourself to be comfortable with the actions you would be taking if these traits were embedded in your personality  acting against your personal profile can be very stressful  though  and might lead to an unsatisfying conclusion      what do you think about being an entrepreneur  is it something anybody can do with a little practice or are there certain personality traits necessary for success  would you consider starting your own business if you felt it was a better path to greater financial well being over time      the original version of this article   the

      many wal mart locations around the country now have money center departments  these developments create an incredibly convenient way to take your paycheck into the store  have it cashed at the money center  and use your cash for your shopping trip  with wal mart’s trend to become a one stop shop for all household needs  including groceries  each wal mart location is becoming its own small mall — or even village     the wal mart money centers are not full banks  they offer check cashing services  bill payments  outgoing wires  and reloadable debit cards  there are no checking accounts or savings accounts  wal mart abandoned its plans to become a bank  and in doing so  is able to offer certain financial services while not being held to the same regulations as chase  bank of america  or your local bank branch  on the spectrum of financial institutions  wal mart money centers are closer to establishments like payday loan companies and check cashing storefronts  who charge high fees and cater to lower income communities and the unbanked population  than the centers are to banks       check cashing fee   the good news is that the fees for cashing your paycheck or government check are generally much lower than the fees at shadier establishments  at the wal mart money center  you can cash your check for a   percent fee with a maximum fee of     of course  you can cash your checks for free at a bank       prepaid debit card fee   the fee to reload and maintain your  prepaid debit card  is lower than fees for prepaid debit cards elsewhere  wal mart uses greendot prepaid debit cards  but at reduced rates of    to load and    per month to maintain  this is a system designed to charge people with low credit scores or a poor history with banks fees to use their own money  these are fees that middle income banking customers doesn’t need to pay  particularly now that  big banks have backed away from charging monthly debit card fees      according to wal mart’s own survey    percent of the customers using the money center have bank accounts  these customers are most likely more interested in the convenience  and willing to accept the fees in exchange for getting access to their money at the same location they shop  the remaining   percent must be the reason wal mart chose to offer its own check cashing service rather than extending a potentially lucrative contract to a bank that could theoretically operate a branch in every wal mart location      are these new services good for the people of wal mart  i’m having trouble finding a significant drawback  i believe it would be better if wal mart were to offer more traditional banking services  but this system is more profitable  the temptation to spend more money when you receive cash from your employer’s paycheck in the store where you’ll be spending money could be an invitation to spend more than necessary  but if you’re spending with cash  at least you’ll be limited to spending only what you have on hand  at the same time  wal mart’s money centers offer a better choice than payday loans and check cashing storefronts for lower income families or the   percent of customers who do not have bank accounts  and could possibly help these households transition to a bank in the future      i do not see wal mart centers as an alternative to banks for most existing banking customers  there is anger towards wall street and the banking system  and initiatives like  bank transfer day  encourage people to move away from the big banks towards credit unions and community banks  the wal mart money center is not a replacement for a big bank  and moving a family from managing finances through a bank to managing finances on an all cash basis through an outfit like these could be detrimental to long term financial stability     photo   aforero     new york times     the original version of this article   wal mart offering check cashing services   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article

      in a competitive credit card market  issuers compete with each other by increasing their benefits  after the slate from chase balance transfer offer became available  citi responded with a sizable sign up bonus for its balance transfer credit card  for a limited time only  new cardholders of the  citi diamond preferred card  will receive a    introductory apr on both purchases and balance transfers for   months  with a    up front statement credit and    balance transfer fee     cardholders qualify for the    statement credit after spending    online within the first three months of owning the card  which is not exactly the best situation for someone intending to use this card for the balance transfer offer  the best balance transfer offers are usually only good deals when the card is used solely for paying off the transferred balance  not for new spending  with a    introductory apr on purchases for   months  however  if new members intend on purchasing holiday gifts online  they could possibly reach the    threshold before the year is over  this new debt can be paid off just as easily at         if you plan to make an event out of black friday or cyber monday by shopping online  the    statement credit could be one of the most beneficial card offers     keep in mind that offer like these are not good for anyone who is not in control of their expenses  good introductory offers can attract spenders to credit cards only to trap them into paying more interest down the road  only take advantage of these offers if you are disciplined and have an emergency fund to draw from if your financial situation changes        when you compare the  citi diamond preferred card  with the  no balance transfer fee slate from chase   there are two things to consider   any cardholder with a balance of      or more would save more money by transferring the balance to the chase card because citi’s fee at    is greater than       conversely  with the citi diamond preferred  the    interest rate lasts a full six months longer  so even if a consumer has to pay a few dollars more to transfer the balance  an additional six months may be worthwhile  it’s a tough call  but this new offer from citi edges out the slate from chase in general  but you have to consider your own specific circumstances     once the introductory interest rate expires  the citi diamond preferred card  which has no annual fee  reverts to the following apr structure             to      variable on purchases and balance transfers depending on quality of credit history         variable cash advance apr         variable default rate apr  initiated when a cardholder is consistently delinquent with late payments or over limit charges       the holidays are a great time to get together with family and friends  but they also bring on the added pressure of buying gifts and spending money on holiday decorations and parties    don’t dig a credit card debt hole deeper than you have to  pay off all your purchases interest free for   months with the  citi diamond preferred card      the original version of this article   citi diamond preferred card    credit and   month balance transfer offer   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      the best online savings accounts offer high interest rates and great customer service  savings accounts  particularly so called “high yield” savings accounts  are best for money you might need within a year  any money that you don’t want to subject to the short term risk and volatility in the stock market should be held safe in a savings account  earning as much interest as possible  your emergency fund should primarily consist of money held in a high yield savings account  “high yield” is unfortunately a bit of a misnomer these days  a decade ago  interest rates were    and    among select savings accounts and money market accounts  today  the best rates are all below    with most around     this trend will continue until banks need more cash from depositors      interest rates   interest rates are important because money shouldn’t lose too much purchasing power  in a perfect world  interest rates offered by banks should beat inflation while preserving the balance without risk  many banks are not now offering a savings option with interest rates high enough to meaningfully beat inflation  so if your savings is at a brick and mortar bank earning below      apy  choose one of the better options below      customer service   when evaluating customer service  there are two important factors to consider  the best banks offer all account maintenance and transfers through a professional  reliable  and easy to navigate website  secondly  live customer service representatives should be knowledgeable  helpful  and available  although customers should have to deal with a representative infrequently if at all     based on my own experiences and reviews from other consumerism commentary readers  here are the most recommended accounts for short term savings  all of the listed interest rates are current as of november    but they are subject to change by the banks  although i have nine accounts listed below the table of rates  you don’t need to have accounts with that many different banks  choose one that fits you the best     first  here is a list of the latest interest rates  following this table  i offer a few of my own observations and opinions about savings accounts from nine popular online banks               function getquerystringvariable variable     var query   window location search substring      var vars   query split        for  var i   i vars length i       var pair   vars i  split        if  pair       variable     return pair                       var ni ad client         var ni rp   getquerystringvariable  type     var ni amt   getquerystringvariable  amount     var ni rpt   getquerystringvariable  term     var                    ni amt                             ni rp                             ni rpt                     
      carl richards is one of today’s best writers focusing on personal finance  originally keeping a great blog at  behaviorgap com   the behavior gap has moved to the new york times  and early next year  carl will release his first book  look for   the behavior gap  simple ways to stop doing dumb things with money   on january           carl’s articles on behavior gap and now his new york times column tend to focus on the psychological aspects of money and are usually centered around cocktail napkin sketches like the example below illustrating how as investors we expect trends to continue into the future          carl richards is also a financial planner  and in a recent new york times feature  he uses an example from his own life to explain how people continue to behave irrationally about money even when they know better  it’s a good indication of why a healthy approach to your finances requires much more than knowing  “spend less than you earn ” we’d like to think that building wealth is as simple as that  but if that were true  anyone who could do simple arithmetic would be financially secure over time     while close friends and family were likely aware of carl’s housing situation a few years ago  he’s just now sharing his experiences with the public  how could a smart financial planner lose his house in las vegas  how could someone strangers rely on for financial advice find himself underwater on his mortgages  it’s not such a stretch when you understand human behavior         we feel comfortable in crowds   when everyone else in our closest circle is behaving a certain way  we feel safe if we are taking the same approach and making the same decisions      we expect trends to continue  see the sketch above  even though reality often differs   in carl’s case  he expected — and everyone around him expected — real estate prices to continue climbing      we trust the professionals   carl qualified for a mortgage at more than   percent of his house’s purchase price  according to his mortgage broker  he wanted to believe the salesperson  despite knowing his fee was based on the loan value  even against his better judgment  he over borrowed        carl’s story also illustrates how easy it is to falsely judge someone’s financial choices from the outside  now with clients in dire financial situations  as a financial planner carl is less likely to judge their choices to spend money  their continued vacations despite the lack of money in the bank could be what is saving their family — or their lives     you can get caught up in the excitement when everyone around you seems to be making choices which look crazy on paper but seem to be resulting in short term success  carl’s example is the real estate frenzy in las vegas in        it felt a little crazy to be shopping for houses that cost half a million dollars  but my income was growing rapidly  everywhere i looked  people were being rewarded for buying as much house as they could possibly afford  and then some  there was this excitement in the air  almost like static  i started to think that if i didn’t buy a house right then  i would never be able to afford one… we’d go to open houses for      homes and see lines of couples in their late  s — younger than we were — waiting to get inside      he refinanced his mortgage  choosing a low payment option that added to his loan balance each month rather than subtracted  then the real estate market crashed in las vegas  and he became underwater on his mortgage  he could continue to pay but owing more on the mortgage than the house was worth  keeping the house was hurting his finances  carl wrestled with what he perceived to be a moral obligation to continue paying his mortgage and the moral obligation to take care of his family      after discussing the issue with other  carl decided that what he had was not a moral obligation with the bank but a contractual obligation  and he should look at the mortgage as a business arrangement  any business would reevaluate their financial situation  and if it was a better decision to stop paying the mortgage in order to qualify for a short sale  despite the credit score hit  that’s what he should do      while this was the logical  mathematical choice  it only became a possibility when carl felt better about breaking his mortgage agreement   human behavior plays a larger role than mathematics  even in this case   again  from the article      the process of making financial decisions is about more than building a spreadsheet to calculate the answer  because life rarely fits cleanly into a spreadsheet  our decisions often appear irrational until we understand the whole story       would you walk away from your house and your mortgage  if you owed more than the house was worth  your loan balance was increasing each month  and you’d be better off financially if you just stopped  i’ve discussed this at consumerism commentary in the past  and the results  based on participation from readers  was mixed  some would  some would not      new york times    behavior gap     the original version of this article   the financial planner who lost his house   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
       focusing solely on your net worth is an approach too narrow if you want to become financially independent over time  to increase your chances of being secure  think about your  personal human capital   a set of skills and experiences that will improve your finances in the future      establish yourself as an authority in your field and create a public image for yourself  when done well  this will help ensure that you and your skills will always be in demand as long as your field is relevant   with technology  establishing yourself is easier today than it has ever been  the internet allows people with similar interests to connect easier  establishing communities and subcommunities offering enough room for many experts and leaders     it starts with a blog  if you develop or write for a popular blog in your field  you could spread your authority far beyond your circle of colleagues  blogging can open even greater opportunities to enhance your renown  including writing published books  appearing on television  and being cited as an expert when news organizations seek sources  the best news is that it’s incredibly easy to start a blog  like a college degree is  for the most part  an entry point for a good career  a blog is the entry point for establishing yourself as a sought after expert in your field     before you start a blog           if you’re anxious to get started  there’s nothing wrong with starting a blog right away  particularly if your motivation comes in spurts  not long after you begin  and before your blog can help you reach a level of authority  you’ll most likely need to think about these questions  take some time and get it right from the start by planning your blog            what is your blog’s mission   the mission of consumerism commentary is “to develop financially literate  capable  and successful human beings by sharing educational  entertaining  and engaging writing ” today  that mission guides almost everything i do related to this website  consumerism commentary has been around for eight and a half years  but i only created this mission recently  i formed the website for different reasons  but if i had focused on this mission from the beginning  the website may be more popular today     as the context of this article is increasing your human capital  your blog will also have a “secret mission ” to establish you as an expert in your field            what is your voice   the growth of a blog and its owner’s reputation within a broad community is related to the content on the website  if you’re focusing on writing articles  read often  write often  and learn how to infuse your personality into your published thoughts  even if you’re already an established expert in your field  your skills may not immediately translate to engaging prose  so practice writing for the public     if you plan to focus your website on video  again  practice being coherent and engaging in front of the camera  find the approach you want to take with your voice  mannerisms  and attitude  you might change your approach later when you have a chance to test what works best in front of the audience  but the more you can prepare even by testing among your friends the better you’ll be able to quickly establish yourself once you start releasing your thoughts on the public         what can visitors expect   do you want to produce content on a daily basis  do you feel you’d be better served by less frequent but more in depth articles  much of your decision might come after practice  only then might you be able to determine what works best for you  at the outset  choose an approach and stick with it  only to provide some consistency      what is your blog’s name   sometimes this step comes first — a name inspires how you approach your blog  your blog’s name is your identity  and the choice might be affected by your ultimate plans for the website  if your goal truly is to establish yourself as an expert  tie the blog’s name to your real name  if  on the other hand  you’re interested in building your blog as a “business” and selling it some day  tying your identity to your blog can limit your options  there are many approaches  but to increase your human capital  keep branding simple and make your real name prominent — the opposite of my initial approach to consumerism commentary      do you have a hook   again from a marketing and branding perspective  you may want to consider a concept to identify with   erica  was a web developer who started her own web hosting company  sold her business for      million  and is now a successful web based entrepreneur  thanks in part to how she markets herself  she focuses on the business selling aspect of her experience  this is the hook that draws people in  turning visitors to readers and readers to fans  not without a healthy dose of critics  as well   the hook works  what’s yours        how to start a blog    at the risk of sounding like an ad  i suggest visiting  wordpress com  and starting a blog  it will take less than five minutes  there are other services out there  but wordpress is very popular and easy to learn  you will have an option to add extras to your blog  such as your own domain name  you may be reluctant to pay for some of the extra features like a domain name at first  but the fee is small and the benefit to your perceived expertise is worthwhile      that mostly takes care of the technical aspect of getting started  once you’ve established your framework  you can get started preparing your website for the initial launch  in a perfect world  you’d probably like to have these tasks completed before releasing your blog to the public and letting the world know about it  if you are anxious to get your name out there  you might not feel like waiting  my suggestion is to get your website to a point where it has engaging and deep content before you launch  because this will show even your first visitor that you are serious about what you are doing        begin writing or posting regularly on your website  building an archive of content  have enough to keep a visitor engaged  consider having enough to keep someone engaged for an hour  reading  watching videos  or otherwise consuming your product  before promoting your new blog     select and customize a pleasing and navigable design  wordpress offers many options for your website’s design and layout  and with a little practice  you should determine how you can customize both     determine how to categorize your content and build out these sections of your site  typical layout calls for a small number of high level sections listed near the top of your website  you should also have an area of your website dedicated to your personal information  include who you are  why you’re an expert  and a method of contacting you  be sure to include any relevant information that could enhance your reputation        once your blog is established  you need to let people know of its existence  find similar websites  participate in discussions  join communities  and determine how to use social media like facebook and twitter effectively  use press release services like  prweb  to your advantage when there’s an opportunity to do so legitimately      move beyond your own blog    publishing your thoughts to increase your human capital isn’t limited to blogs  a blog will help you promote your other writing and open doors for you  however  with an archive of great content  you will be able to point to your history of excellent writing when looking to advance your reputation beyond the confines of your own website        offer to write articles for other respected bloggers within your community     seek opportunities to contribute to major publications like newspapers or industry journals     take a specific idea and publish your own book or e book     approach publishers with a concept for a book  pointing to your history — and importantly  the community of fans you’ve built — as a rationalization for a book deal     if you prefer developing video content over writing  look for opportunities to be on television  and perhaps  produce your own show        the goal is to boost your human capital through establishing an expert identity for yourself  if you’re well respected online and are able to establish yourself beyond others in your field  potential employers and clients will seek you out  you will have more opportunities to grow your wealth and use that wealth to achieve the  real goals  you have for your life     there is much more that could be said about developing a blog to promote yourself as an expert  each aspect of creating a successful online identity  including creating content  mastering the most effective layout  and marketing yourself  has generated enough interest among the public to warrant blogs and books devoted to these topics  this overview doesn’t even touch on directly  generating  revenue from your blog   but that is a separate goal from what is discussed here  establishing yourself as an expert  focus on creating something that establishes you before worrying about income  the expense is minimal except for your time      if you’re concerned about return on investment  keep in mind the goal is to increase your human capital  the benefit of which only reveals itself over a long period of time     keep in mind that  the bar has been raised   it is easy to start a blog  so it takes much more than just starting and producing consistent content to establish yourself as an expert through your blog   hold yourself to the highest standards and settle for nothing but the best you can do      the original version of this article   boost your human capital  publish your thoughts   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article

      the wealth gap is growing  and if the occupy wall street and its satellite protests are any indication  those not within the top one percent of income earners are not happy with their circumstances or the policies that help foster the wealth of those at the top  it’s been called class warfare  but there are other dimensions to the wealth gap than the spectrum that includes poor  working middle class  upper middle class  and wealthy     the gap in wealth between young and old americans is growing  today  the pew research center released new data showing the widening divide between americans   years old or younger and americans   and older  in    the median net worth for the younger group was       adjusted for inflation   the same year  the median net worth for the older group was       net worth includes the value of all one’s assets  including a house  minus the value of all one’s liabilities  including student loan debt  credit card debt  and mortgages      the passing of twenty five years makes a difference  today’s median net worth — actually not today’s number  but  ′s number — for americans   years old or younger is       that’s a    decline  today’s youth is significantly less wealthy than the youth of the previous generation  in    the older group’s median net worth was       a    increase       this is a comparison between age groups  which i would expect to be fairly similar to each other and similar to the past in terms of socioeconomic distribution  they would have to be  or the data would need to be standardized  for the numbers to have merit  there are great reasons to be happy about the increase of wealth in one group  but there is also a wide variety of reasons why young people  and i am one — i’ll remain   for just a few more months  if all goes well         unemployment within the young age group is high  while older workers are opting to stay in their jobs longer  in fact  recent graduates facing unemployment  may never reach their income potential   this problem isn’t just going to go away when the job market improves     some call today’s young adults  or old adolescents  the  boomerang generation   after college  they move back to their parents’ house while looking for a job  they delay marriage and purchasing a house  both activities that are correlated with increased wealth  yesterday’s recent graduates had jobs and houses  both of which contributed to gains over the past   years  particularly if the house was purchased in advance of the real estate bubble      student loan debt  is a much more significant part of a young person’s life today than it was in    college costs have far outpaced inflation  and lenders have always been keen to extend the availability of higher education to more students  otherwise known as borrowers and customers      a college education is increasingly seen as the gateway to a good career in any field  it’s difficult to compete in an information based economy  opposed to a manufacturing based economy  without a bachelor’s degree  a  high school diploma is no longer enough  for participation  particularly when companies can afford to be selective in hiring         if you’re in the younger group  the question should always be what you can do to reverse this trend  while there can be some results by supporting public policies that don’t include bail outs for the rich  socialization of losses  while cutting back resources for those with the least opportunity  privatizing the gains   it’s important to put yourself in the best position possible so that you don’t need to rely on public policy in your favor     assume you’re a major league baseball player   that will easily put you in a position where your wealth is quite healthy  but that’s besides the point at the moment  just go with the unexpected metaphor for a second   you have three balls and two strikes  there are two outs  you’re down by one run  the bases are loaded  and it’s the bottom of the ninth inning  you hit your next pitch to the shortstop  he mishandles the ball but gets it over to first base  it’s a close play  a tie  but the umpire calls you out  your manager rushes the field from the dugout to argue  but it’s no use  you head back to the showers momentarily defeated      it’s easy to blame the umpire for getting the call wrong on such an important play  it’s your job to perform well enough that there’s never any question about whether you’re safe or out  the “system” that requires an umpire to make a snap judgment call on a close play is the same “system” that makes it difficult for people to succeed financially  by  taking control of your finances   you make the “system” — the job market  the economy  politician’s policies  to name a few societal aspects that aren’t easily controlled by one person — less relevant to your long term success     photo   jinx      pew research center     the original version of this article   wealth gap

      there have been times in my life  while working for other people or companies  that i’ve thought to myself   i should have more job responsibility than this   or   i should be getting paid more than i am   a disagreement with the boss over my skills  potential  and value to the organization created tension  for some people  this tension could be demotivating      dissatisfaction with career progress is often not something that could be blamed on the company on the boss  sometimes it’s due to a bad fit between people  but more likely  employees can look at themselves to find the barrier to success in a career  here are a few possibilities          you haven’t defined what you really want   the first step to getting what you want out of a career is having a clear goal with a series of steps that will get you there  knowing where you’d like to be in your career helps you carry a sense of purpose in your job  if career advancement isn’t important to you and you haven’t found a need to define any goals  chances are your boss will keep you right where you are  if you have a goal in mind and are willing to put in the effort to show why you can accept more responsibilities  you have a better chance of moving ahead         you haven’t discussed your career with your boss   while the best organizations are partners with employees in the career building process  the initiative must come from the employees  after you have clear career goals and a personal job related mission  you must share that with the people in your organization who can help make that happen  i’ve been too quiet about my desires in the past  and it has hurt me  after the fact  i’ve had bosses tell me that they didn’t know i wanted more responsibility  you may think you are showing the organization what you want through your actions  but in most cases  career desires need to be discussed explicitly         you aren’t passionate about your work   not everyone is lucky enough to be able to  follow passions   the missions that people are more likely to be passionate about are in fields in which is may be difficult to make a living  if your passion is fine art and the only job you can see yourself doing is a painting artistic landscapes  the competition to become one of the few painters who can earn a solid living on their art is tough  if your passion is in a field that pays well  like engineering  you have a better shot  most people settle  and particularly in job markets that favor employers  people often take the jobs they can get and don’t factor passion into the equation      when you’re not passionate about your work  it’s more difficult to summon up the intrinsic motivation that’s required to not only do what’s asked of you  but to go beyond the call of duty and excel  impressing the decision makers in your organization  find something about your job to be passionate about  even if it’s not the job itself         you haven’t clarified why you deserve more   few people enjoy talking about themselves  particularly if it could be seen as bragging  unfortunately  managers are busy and often don’t see everything you do  this information should come out in annual performance reviews if your organization participates in this ritual  but these reviews tend to be formalities after management has already decided whether you receive a promotion or a raise  set up time to review your progress with your boss on a much more frequent basis  even if discussed informally  let her know that you’re succeeding in ways that may not be immediately visible to a busy manager who focuses on many different people every day     you may also need to make the connection for your manager  explain not only what you’ve done but the effect these activities had or will have on the organization         you’re not talking to the right decision maker   you may have had all the right discussions with the wrong individual  at one company  i knew my direct supervisor had a good idea of where i wanted to be  but she wasn’t the person who could help move my career in the right direction  while she always claimed to be working on my behalf  for my to see career success  i needed to have more open communication with her supervisors — not her direct supervisor  but her boss’s boss  two layers in a corporate hierarchy up  when you need to jump ranks in order to move your career forward  it can tend to be intimidating  you don’t deal with your boss’s boss’s boss on a regular basis  but she might be the one who needs to know what your goals and desires are  she needs to know how you’ve succeeded  and she needs to she your passion      relying on long communication chain may be respectful of rank  but in the end  it’s not going to get you anywhere     there might be other reasons you’re unhappy with your career progress  perhaps the company just isn’t a good match for you  perhaps your management plays favorites  perhaps you’d succeed further working for yourself  perhaps your management isn’t lying when they say the company has no money  rather than focus on these external factors  look within  if you believe the career path you’re on is the right path for you and you’re undervalued  you can change your approach to increase your chances of being noticed positively     photo   plastanka     the original version of this article     reasons you’re unhappy

      in the midst of the economic recession a few years ago  layaway programs made a big comeback  previously a great method for buying items that may have been on the expensive side in eras when credit was not available to many consumers  the same economic conditions returned when credit card offers became scarce recently  layaway programs are popular around the holidays  because consumers who plan in advance can reserve popular gifts  like the  year’s hottest toys   while saving for the complete purchase  regardless of whether a  credit card  is available     taking walmart’s layaway program as an example  we can draw a comparison between shopping with a layaway program  using a credit card  and paying with cash  assume you use walmart’s full layaway period  october   through december    you make payments for two months before receiving your item  and you pay a    up front fee for the privilege  assume also you are buying items that cost    in total  the    fee over two months equates roughly to a    annual percentage rate  that’s not that much different from credit card rates  possibly a little lower than average     with a credit card  however  you can take the purchased item home immediately  with layaway  the store holds the product for you until you’ve completed your payments  if you decide later on not to finish purchasing an item on layaway  you’ll need to pay another fee in order to get your initial deposit of    of the item price and any subsequent payments back     without a layaway program or a credit card  you would need to save on your own before having enough cash to buy your items  if it takes two months to save up  you would receive the item at the same time you would have if you had taken advantage of layaway  but without the item reserved for you  it might be sold out by the time you can afford to buy it  that’s reason enough to avoid some of the most popular holiday gifts  the best option is to save for your holiday spending — or spending for any large item for which a layaway program would be beneficial — well enough in advance of needing to complete the purchase     there are several benefits of taking advantage of a layaway program for holiday shopping        reserve your item in advance  ensuring the popular item will be available later     avoid traditional banks and credit cards  and likely pay smaller fees     keep your savings in your bank account        layaway programs provide an alternative to saving in advance  with a fee to pay for the privilege  in some cases  it can be a better deal than paying with a credit card  though consumers making credit card payments have the advantage of taking the purchased item home immediately      besides these benefits  there are potential drawbacks and dangers  one important drawback of layaway programs is that you lock in the price when you place your downpayment  if the store offers a sale later on  you won’t be able to take advantage of the lower price without cancelling your layaway and incurring fees to do so  if the item you wish to buy is offered at a deep discount  you may be willing to incur the cancellation fee  but otherwise the result is paying more to take home an item than shoppers who bought the item that day without the help of layaway     be aware of your store’s policies  while the cancellation of a layaway program usually won’t prevent a full refund  minus fees   some stores take a stronger stance and offer no refunds     there is a lot of pressure to buy gifts during the holiday season in an effort not to disappoint loved ones  it’s much easier to manage expectations — or it can be  if a family has a philosophy of managing expectations already — than to jump through financial hoops to buy the latest and greatest trendy gifts       have you taken advantage of a layaway program      the original version of this article   layaway programs  how to buy what you can’t afford  yet    is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
       this is a guest article by emily guy birken  author of  the sahmambulust   in this article  she offers suggestions for cutting the costs associated with car ownership      owning a car is an expensive proposition  but most of us never stop to consider the cost of each trip  unless you live in a city with great public transportation  you use a car for everything  we jump into our cars to commute  run errands  visit friends  go shopping or even just take in the fall foliage   be proactive  about your car to keep your ownership costs low      here are five ways to make sure that your car remains a manageable expense  rather than a financial black hole     don’t cheap out on a mechanic     when you find a reputable mechanic whom you trust  don’t expect to see bargain basement bills   mechanics not only have to stay on top of the ever changing trends of car engines  but they also need to make sure their  very expensive  tools keep up with cars’ needs and are well maintained   a knowledgeable mechanic is worth the extra money   one who doesn’t know what he is doing but will save you a couple of bucks can often cause expensive harm to your car   this is not the place to try to save   you’ll spend less in the long run if you’re willing to pay a great mechanic     looking for the cheapest mechanic will cost you more money in future repairs  so don’t be  penny wise  pound foolish   think about the larger picture     make smart gas choices     there may be a great deal of hype about premium fuel options  but most daily drivers are just fine with the lowest octane gas at the pump   if you’re not sure about your car’s gas needs  check your owner’s manual   even if the recommendation is for the premium grade of fuel  chances are that you would only need to fork over for the high grade stuff in warm weather  when hauling extra weight  or driving on extremely steep mountain roads   any other times  save yourself the money   and if you’re still not sure what your car needs  talk to your mechanic or check the internet message boards devoted to your make and model—there are plenty of them     watch the advertised prices as the station  you may  pay more for your gas if you use a credit card   because many stations now charge gas customers different prices depending on whether they use cash or a credit card  you may be able to make up some of the difference with a  gas rewards credit card   but again  make sure the price you pay above the cash price is worth the benefits     provided you pay off your credit card each month  this could be a savvy way to reduce your fuel bill each month and keep you motoring for less  as long as you make smart choices     take good care of your tires     tires are one of the costliest items that you will have to replace during the life of the car   while they are not made to last forever  you can ensure you get your money’s worth out of each set by practicing good maintenance   keeping the tires properly inflated will not only make sure they last but will also save you on fuel efficiency   check your tires monthly for underinflation and wear     keep your car clean     if you live in an area with long  cold winters  you’re probably surrounded by cars that are rusting away   cars that are exposed to salt will succumb to rust  which can shorten the lifespan of the vehicle   especially in winter  you want to make sure that your car is regularly cleaned and waxed to keep the metal safe from the eroding properties of salt     similarly  if you notice a chip of paint missing from your body  touch it up   that spot is open to the elements and salt and will eventually rust over     don’t ignore little problems     a friend’s car was revving but not catching when he turned the ignition   when he tried again  the car started and he went along his way   the problem   he was short on transmission fluid  had he not topped off that fluid  he could have destroyed his transmission and been looking at a multi thousand dollar repair bill  plus an out of commission car  because he took care of the problem quickly  he paid just a few dollars for transmission fluid instead of using his maintenance budget for the year in one shot  we can become so used to the idea that we just jump in the car that we can sometimes end up ignoring small warning signs   if your car is behaving oddly  get it to a trusted mechanic quickly   always pay attention to small issues      maintaining your car is an investment  that will keep you motoring for years after your less savvy neighbors and friends have had to replace their vehicles and spent unnecessary costs       photo   sridgway     the original version of this article     saving money tips for car owners   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      i’ve noticed over the past few years that the fees and surcharges that appear on my hotel bills are creeping steadily upward  i’m apparently not alone with this observation  according to a new study by dr  bjorn hanson from the nyu school of continuing and professional studies  hotel fees and surcharges will account for      billion revenue in    up from      billion in    the increase comes from higher fees as well as more travelers  or escapists  spending time in hotels     this doesn’t take into account the various taxes that appear on hotel bills  on a recent trip to california  my itemized hotel bill includes an occupancy sales tax    percent  and a convention and tourism tax      percent   in addition to the taxes  if i had done anything in the hotel other than sleep  i might have seen my bill peppered with fees such as telephone calls  internet fees  early check in fees  late departure fees  business center fees  and if the hotel had been a little nicer  a resort fee      here are a few suggestions for avoiding hotel fees and saving money while traveling         know your fees before you travel   unfortunately  many hotels make it difficult to have full knowledge of fees during comparison shopping  if you book your hotel room by using a website that compares rates at a variety of hotel brands  you’re only seeing the full story  airlines have found this to be an advantage  and hotels are following suit  the least expensive hotel when comparing nightly rates may enforce additional surcharges     one solution is to look at the individual hotels’ websites  but not every hotel is gracious enough to list all the fees that they may charge  you might have better luck calling the hotel directly and asking for the details         negotiate your rates   when i’ve put in an effort  i’ve had some success reducing the overall nightly rates and negotiating removal of some fees  particularly internet access fees  you may not have much room for negotiation if you book your travel using a third party website or even the hotel’s own online booking system  but taking the small step of calling the hotel — and you just called to ask about fees  anyway — and asking for the best rates and fee considerations can work well  if you can pit one hotel’s offer against a local  comparable hotel’s offer  you could have even more success         bring your own internet service   if your business involves the internet  as mine does  you may find you need to be connected more often than not  earlier this year  i decided to bring the internet with me by getting a mobile wifi hotspot from my wireless provider  verizon wireless  it has helped me in a number of situations where i needed to have internet access while i was away from home  the service can be worthwhile for anyone who travels while needing to be online      mobile wifi may be more expensive than a few nights each month with hotel provided internet access  but if you need to be online on the road  the service is better than hotel room internet         avoid resort hotels   you would think that more expensive hotels would include more services  i’ve seen charges at fancier hotels for services that less expensive hotels offer for free  in a resort hotel  you may find it hard to resist the temptation to take advantage of some of the more unique services  like spa access          don’t call room service   if you’re planning for a longer stay  look for kitchen availability in the room and prepare your own meals  with a local grocery store  you could avoid dining out as well as relying on the hotel’s own expensive kitchen         stay with friends or family rather than the hotel   if you know your stay won’t be a burden  and you need to travel while spending as little money as possible  you might be successful crashing on a couch as a guest          couchsurf   couchsurfing is one of the newest travel trends  like the above tip  the comfort of a home often beats a hotel  and you never have to worry about hidden fees  with couchsurfing  you’ll need to trust a stranger as a host  but you can review a potential host’s references on  couchsurfing com          carry your own baggage   if you are staying in a hotel  one of the great conveniences is the presence of porters who help move your bags from the lobby to your room  for a nomial fee encouraged by an outstretched palm  in most cases  this service is unnecessary  this is one of the smaller fees you may be expected to pay  but if your goal is to take the most frugal approach  it’s easily avoidable         park elsewhere   if you’re staying at a hotel where space is at a premium  within a city for example  you may be subjecting yourself to a fee for parking  if you must bring a car  you might be able to find a parking lot nearby for less money          leave yourself enough time to review your bill   if you’re rushing to check out quickly in order to catch a flight or your next appointment  you might not give your hotel bill the attention it deserves  some hotels are kind enough to slip your bill under your door early on your check out date  but if not  leave enough time to review your bill line by line  if there is a charge you don’t agree with  have it removed by talking to the manager  this happened to me on one of the first hotel stays i experienced as an adult responsible for paying the bill — and at a time when i probably didn’t have enough money for taking vacations  anyway       what’s your favorite hotel fee      photo   kevin dooley     the original

      earlier this year  discover launched a no balance transfer fee credit card offer that was available for a full three months  an unexpected offer given the trend towards increased balance transfer fees following the recession  credit cards with these attractive balance transfer offers are generally the least profitable for card issuers  and it had been years since any issuer took a big risk by offering a fee free balance transfer  today  chase has also taken that leap of faith by offering the  slate® from chase – limited time  no balance transfer fee  credit card offer  i expect this will only be available for a short time  so for anyone who has a high apr balance on a credit card  this is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of a big discount on interest expenses         the  slate® from chase – limited time  no balance transfer fee  offer provides a    introductory apr on purchases and balance transfers for   months   this is offered only to applicants who have good or excellent credit  this deal is reserved for the best risks in the eyes of chase  approved applicants with average credit will receive a    introductory apr on balance transfers for only six months   all other card offers available publicly today come with a fee for balance transfers  usually   to   percent of the balance transferred  chase is the only bank currently offering this perk  and this is the only chase card for which the benefit is available  the   percent minimum balance transfer fee charged by other issuers cuts into the savings a balance transfer offer provides     for example  a cardholder with a      balance looking for a lower interest rate transfers the entire balance to another credit card  with a   percent balance transfer fee  the new balance is already       with the slate® from chase – limited time  no balance transfer fee  the new balance would remain       saving the customer    in comparison  the higher the balance transfer  the greater the potential savings      once the introductory rate expires  the standard purchase apr on the slate® from chase – limited time  no balance transfer fee becomes            or      variable  depending on quality of credit history   chase does not charge an annual fee  so card holders who do not charge beyond their credit limits and who pay their bills on time will never pay chase a dime for the privilege      citibank has been the leader of balance transfer offers  but this no balance transfer fee offer from chase is putting pressure on citi  citi currently offers a     introductory apr on purchases and balance transfers for   months   with a    fee   so depending on how long a consumer needs to make interest free payments  the slate from chase could present a unique opportunity to save even more money   remember that this is a very limited time offer so to take advantage  apply for or review more information about the  slate® from chase – limited time  no balance transfer fee  offer     the original version of this article   slate from chase limited time no balance transfer fee review   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      when a sales approach reveals itself to be significantly profitable for a company  you can bet those who run that company will want to expand that approach  last year’s “black friday” day after thanksgiving sale on amazon com was popular  and this year the major online retailer is extending the event throughout the week leading up to thanksgiving  and offering publicized deals throughout the entire month of november  counting down to the start of “black friday deals week ”    the  black friday deals week countdown  features electronics  home and kitchen  and jewelry  but amazon has deals throughout all categories  the featured deals follow the style of amazon’s “lightning deals ” where the retailer offers a usually deeply discounted item every several hours in limited quantities and for a limited time  the deals are not announced ahead of time  so in order to take advantage  shoppers would need to check amazon com often     shopping online beats running around from store to store on black friday  running the risk of being trampled by crazy shoppers  on the other hand  you may miss out on a retailer’s best doorbuster type deals if you don’t get out of the house  some companies take advantage of the fact that this is the one time of the year that a large population of consumers are obsessed with finding great deals  and it’s easy for retailers to present an offer as a once in a lifetime discount for shoppers who haven’t properly researched their desires  an event like black friday also open the opportunity for retailers to take advantage of the impulse reaction  leading people to buy what they don’t need simply for the feeling of scoring a great deal     perhaps i’ve become lazier over the last few years  except in a few specific situations  namely photography equipment  i’ve found that amazon com consistently offers lower prices on the items i find myself needing or wanting most often  i often don’t bother to shop around unless it’s for a major purchase  if amazon’s price ends up being slightly higher  i don’t worry too much  thanks to all the money i’ve saved over the past decade  my overall savings compared with shopping at retailers like best buy and circuit city more than make up for the difference      how closely will you monitor amazon com’s  black friday deals week countdown    i might visit the site several times a week to see what the trends are  i haven’t organized a shopping list for the holidays yet     related   christmas gift ideas under     and  best holiday toys for        the original version of this article   amazon com’s month of black friday deals   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      after  wells fargo  chase bank  suntrust bank  and regions bank dropped their plans for debit card fees yesterday   the largest bank in the united states  the only bank holding onto its policy of eliminating unprofitable customers by annoying them with inconvenient fees  dropped their own plans to enact a    monthly debit card fee in       the wall street journal is reporting that thanks to customer backlash and likely due to a public relations nightmare  the bank is reversing its policy  it’s a smart move  but is it too late  bank of america has done a great job burning an imagine in customers’ minds of a bank that is willing to sacrifice its customers — not to recover from a potential loss  but to recover from a lower profit due to regulators’ new rules against excessive interchange fees  corporations are expected to look for profit under every rock  but this particular type of fee hurts low income customers much more than high income customers  you would have been able to avoid the potential fee by having a significant balance of deposits held at the bank  much more than the typical customer might hold     on twitter   michael kitces  from  kitces com  said in response to my comment about the fee cancellation  “i think people that boa didn’t want as customers still got the message loud   clear  even if boa drops the fee now ”  kyle  from  amateur asset allocator  responded  “doesn’t affect my attitude one way or another  if i were affected  i’d probably just go to cash only instead of using the debit card ”    this doesn’t affect plans for  bank transfer day   this fee could have been the wake up call consumers needed to gain the extra motivation to move to a credit union  as we’ve seen with the interchange fee regulation  a window of potential profit closed in one area leads to another window opening somewhere else  bank of america and the other banks who dropped plans for a debit card fee will find a way to earn their profits  and the next fee may not be nearly as transparent and well marketed as the debit card fee     keep an eye on those bank statements      wall street journal     the original version of this article   we did it  bank of america dropping    debit card fee proposal   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      i recently received reader feedback from a conscious saver who is planning to move his money from wells fargo to a credit union  she won’t make the  bank transfer day  november   goal  because the credit union’s branch is planned to open november    this reader plans to be one of the new branch’s first customers      this reader wrote into consumerism commentary not to write about the effort to move away from big banks  she volunteers for charitable organizations and is wondering why there is no tax benefit available for volunteer time  charitable financial contributions  such as cash  stocks  or property  are often tax deductible if the organization receiving the donation is a registered non profit  i’ve taken advantage of these tax deductions for several years  but for me  the purpose of contributing to non profit organizations is not the tax deduction  the purpose is to legitimately help an organization whose mission is meaningful to me and my worldview      i’ve been lucky to be in a financial situation where contributing to organizations would not endanger my own bank account  another method of donation that can have a great effect on an organization is spending time as a volunteer  in my experience  most non profit organizations do not generate enough revenue from operations or fundraising to maintain a healthy payroll  they often rely on passionate volunteers to handle a large amount of work  if you don’t have a large amount of money to provide an organization  you could be more beneficial to the group by offering your services as an unpaid volunteer      if the more financially comfortable money donors receive a benefit from the government for their assistance in the form of a tax deduction  shouldn’t volunteers receive a benefit related to the financial value of their time and work  furthermore  the requirement that taxpayers need to itemize deductions in order to receive the charitable contribution deduction results in lower income taxpayers  who are less likely to itemize  don’t take a deduction they might deserve  this tax deduction favors upper middle class and above because they are more likely to have money to share and are more likely to itemize deductions     the congressional budget office agrees with me  “such tax incentives are limited  however  to the subset of taxpayers who itemize  and they favor high income people  who face relatively higher marginal tax rates ”    while the feeling of being a positive force in the world should be a good enough motivator for working with organizations whose missions you’re passionate about  why should one form of contribution be encouraged through tax policy while another is not     the war revenue act of   established the charitable contributions deduction  only four years after the federal income tax as we know it was established  it’s long been a part of the u s  tax code and isn’t likely to go away  particularly because it’s not only individuals who take advantage of the benefit  some corporations can deduct up to    of their taxable income  and you can be sure that regardless of corporate goals  shareholders want their companies to reduce expenses for taxes as much as possible  major contributions also constitute great public relations  helping prospective customers associate good deeds with the company     understanding that the tax deduction for charitable contributions would never go away without a major overhaul of the u s  tax code  is there a place for additional deductions for time and effort spent volunteering     there would be a few challenges         fraud   with a financial transaction  the bank has a record that can be submitted to the irs for proof if called upon to do so  without an independent verification of the time spent volunteering  it would be too easy to submit false documentation and take advantage of the system      valuation   how do you put a value on one hour spent as a volunteer  the value of time has always generated good discussion  is an hour from a ceo who sacrifices the time he could be spending building a company  creating jobs  to be a volunteer more valuable than an hour from a high school student who is looking for opportunities to enhance his college applications  if the ceo spends his time stuffing envelopes with fundraising postcards and the student takes an hour to organize an event having a direct impact on an elderly community  is each hour rated the same        these issues are not insurmountable  but it would take some planning to develop a method of making the tax deduction verifiable and fair  with tax policy set by lobbyists  we may never see an arrangement like this within the tax code  unless corporations were to find value in spending time rather than money for charitable causes  there would not be enough pressure on politicians to change the rule     the reader who brought this idea to my attention also asked the following  “how do we make suggestions to the tax laws   is there a process for raising such an issue ”    the first stop is your local representative and senators  send letters  call their offices  and get more people to do the same  laws can be changed by citizens  but it would take a significant effort  if you feel strongly about the issue  convince others to take up the cause with you     it’s almost thanksgiving  so take a page from arlo guthrie’s  alice’s restaurant   for people to change even a small aspect of the tax code  it’s going to take a movement  if you’re passionate about

       while saving money  reducing expenses  and earning income all help improve your net worth  these tactics often ignore the larger picture  improving your personal human capital is like a form of insurance  you’re protecting your ability to increase your net worth over a long period of time   boosting your human capital  through gaining education  adding variety to your experiences  and cultivating your network can help to ensure you’re in a better financial position in the future       i’m what carl jung would call an introvert   to be more specific  in the variety of corporate psychological analyses i’ve participated in over the past fifteen years  my result is generally halfway between introvert and extravert  though i identify more with the introvert qualities  this doesn’t mean i always prefer to work by myself or spend time alone  it means that i can draw energy from independent thinking  i am comfortable in social situations with large groups of people as well as working in teams  but rather than drawing energy from this type of socialization  it draws energy from me      as a result of this energy drain  i haven’t put as much effort into networking as an independent business owner like myself should have  i’ve been building online communities of various types since at least    but i haven’t done a great job with maintaining relationships over time  from a social perspective  i prefer to have a few close contacts than a large number of acquaintances  not only does this make it difficult for people to get close to me  but it has perhaps damaged my personal human capital     when to say yes    the overworked and overscheduled business owner receives standard advice  “know when to say no ” one person cannot do everything  and those who have shown themselves to be experts are often faced with ceaseless requests for assistance  focusing effort on the   percent of requests that have   percent of the most relevance to the expert’s own needs  an approach that borrows from the  pareto principle   might benefit from lighter schedules but might miss the opportunity to have a significant effect on someone’s life     keeping in mind that it could be damaging to over promise and under deliver  i take the approach of responding to as many requests as possible  looking at each as an opportunity to connect with someone i may not know about      both depth and breadth are important    i mentioned above that i’m more comfortable with fewer close relationships than more superficial connections  this limits my capacity for improving my overall human capital  the most beneficial network contains both deep relationships and a wide network      an individual beginning a new business as a landlord or real estate investor is a good example of someone whose human capital increases significantly with a wide network  in order for an investment to be profitable  unless the investor intends to spend all of his time and effort handling every detail regarding the property  he or she needs to know a variety of people in positions to help  while one can find plumbers  contractors  painters  property managers  and real estate agents by searching online  the best help — and the better deals — would come from people the investor knows personally  recommendations from friends or other investors could fill in some holes in the network  and every interaction through a recommendation can grow this network     for someone building a photography business  initial help could come from the deeper relationships in the individual’s inner circle  those who would trust the photographer enough to help build an initial portfolio and be willing to recommend the photographer to friends in the early stages of the business     the value of online networking tools    linkedin has become the one location for the best business focused networking  despite this  i am not convinced that online only networking — or just having a massive contact list — is valuable  i receive connection requests every day from people i’ve never communicated with  whether in person or through email  i don’t see the benefit of growing the list just to have a high connection count  just like the purpose of earning more money or reducing expenses is  not  just to have a larger bank balance      as linkedin has grown  more features seem to invite unwanted messages and self aggrandizement  i see linkedin as an effective contact management system  where you can be sure your most important contacts also offer their latest information  this is much more efficient than maintaining a little black book when contacts frequently change jobs  positions  email addresses  and phone numbers     professional organizations    starting in college  you can join professional organizations that provide opportunities to expand your network and open opportunities that might not have been available otherwise  as a music education major  i re established the university’s collegiate chapter of a major national organization related to the field  had i remained in this field  i would have been able to draw upon the contacts i established at this organization for professional opportunities   you never know what path your life might take  but it doesn’t hurt to prepare for the path you intend to take at any particular time      in my career as an independent financial blogger  it was rewarding to establish an informal association of like minded writers  as a small  tightly knit group  we could easily share ideas and best practices to help our budding businesses grow     mentoring relationships    focusing on the depth rather than breadth of connections  the relationship between a mentor and protege can be a helpful for building personal human capital  seeking a respected individual in your field to play the role of a mentor can help you have an avenue for asking direct questions where the answers will help you reach your goals  no matter where you are in life  there is always someone from whom you can learn  even the most successful individuals in the world find time to speak to people they respect to come away from a discussion with more ideas or tools     at the same time  being a mentor can be very rewarding  often  a protege asks a question that forces you to solidify your thoughts and opinions  by talking through your approach to any particular issue helps you think about details that may seem self explanatory  in the variety of relationships in which i’ve served as a mentor  i’ve found that i’ve learned more about myself and my life and business have both improved as a result     one danger in this relationship is being defined by the role in nominal terms  mentors can learn from proteges  everyone has something to offer     five tips for building an effective human network        be authentic   don’t present yourself as someone you’re not      reciprocate   don’t take more from a relationship than you’re prepared to give  say yes often      focus on depth and breadth   don’t just be a contact collector  add depth to the relationships that matter most      facilitate connections   rather than focusing solely on the relationships that will help you  note where your contacts will benefit from building a relationship with your other connections      follow meetings with a message   responding or connecting quickly after a meeting will help build relationships faster         do you have any additional tips for networking  what has worked well for you      photo

       this article is written by consumerism commentary’s columnist  ellen cooper davis  ellen’s column looks at the role of spirituality within the context of personal finance  for an introduction to this column  see ellen’s first article   the pastor and the purse   your feedback is welcome      it’s time for a little geography lesson     look at the tag in your pants  right there  below the strict instructions not to put them in the drier  which you  like me  probably ignore  it tells you where your pants were born  “made in mauritius ” my pants tell me   the magic interwebs let me know that this is a tiny island nation off the southeast coast of africa      now i am curious  because in my experience  small island nations don’t necessarily fare well where clothing manufacturing is concerned  so even though a part of me doesn’t really want to know…i check on the labor practices of the manufacturer  the results are  not encouraging        this means i will have to find a different source of pants  and since i’ve raised the question of ethics in manufacturing  it also means i’m more likely to intentionally seek out brands of clothing that have higher standards   oh  sure  i could shrug and try to forget i ever looked that up  or pretend that sweatshop labor does not clash with my values at all… but it does  and i did  and that’s the problem  once you know something  you can’t un know it     most of us move through our consumer lives in blissful ignorance  we don’t know where our clothing  gadgets  trinkets come from  and frankly  we don’t care  we just want them to look good  work well  and entertain us  we don’t want to know about  child labor  or  sweatshop labor  or  toxins   because if we knew — if we really allowed ourselves to open our eyes and see the truth  and to notice the places where this truth grates against our most deeply held truths — then we would  have to change      ignorance isn’t really bliss  it’s just ignorance  as a society  we would never tolerate knowing nothing about where our food comes from  we want some reasonable assurance that it is safe to eat  that it will nourish us  that it is what it says it is  why would we deliberately embrace ignorance when it comes to materials  labor conditions and sources of other consumer goods  after all  those are real human beings on the other end of our supply chain  to pretend otherwise is not only ignorance  but dangerous     in some ways  this is the essence of any spiritual path  it is about taking the teachings and values of that path  and aligning your real  everyday life with them  this includes what we do  what we say  how we treat people  and what and how we consume  it isn’t easy  and no one does it perfectly  but we can all start where we are  i can start with my next grocery trip  or the next time i need new socks  i can start with rearranging my investment portfolio  or i can start by exploring fair trade gifts for this holiday season   here  at the intersection of soul and money  there are hard questions to be asked   if i am who i say i am  what must i do       what consumer goods do you research from a values perspective   what do you wish you could evaluate from that perspective  but don’t know how  what would you prefer to remain totally ignorant about  are there any “lines in the sand” for you  issues or practices that you absolutely do not tolerate in your consumer choices     the original version of this article   spirituality and money  knowing is only half the battle   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article

      the security and exchange commission  sec  has advised the managers of super secret hedge funds  investments of the most wealthy  that they will soon need to disclose more information to the regulators  highly leveraged hedge funds contributed to the economic collapse  but the pressure to increase oversight has been mostly ignored by the industry  in response to heavy lobbying by the industry  the sec has scaled back the requirements the commission intended to issue  leaving softer regulation likely to be ineffective     hedge fund managers like to keep their operations secret  if managers were required to report underlying investments  trades  and strategies  they might be at a disadvantage  like a patented formula for creating pharmaceutical drugs  hedge fund managers rely on their proprietary operations to ensure no imitators and no rogue competitors using their strategies to cause them to fail  most fund managers need to report their funds’ financial details publicly  with statements that outline the funds’ holdings  risk profile  expenses  and strategy  hedge funds do not have this requirement     the new sec regulations allow hedge funds to file a minimum amount of data pertaining to the investments  and the filing will not be available to the public  only a small committee within the sec will be privileged enough to see the information  additionally  only hedge funds with      billion in assets will be required to report the most detailed information to the sec  funds with over    million in assets need only report the extent that the investments are leveraged  hedge funds with    million in assets or left will not be required to report anything      the required reporting  which grows out of the financial crisis three years ago  is meant to allow financial regulators to monitor the risks that the funds may pose to the nation’s overall financial system  something that officials at the federal reserve  the treasury department and the s e c  did not have during the crisis      by focusing on the largest hedge funds  it may seem like the new reporting requirements will achieve this goal of monitoring and evaluating systemic risk  considering that the largest hedge funds can still get away with reporting vague information about their underlying investments  the sec may still miss big risks     should hedge funds be subject to the same scrutiny as publicly traded companies  does the idea that very few investors take advantage of hedge funds release these managers from public accountability      new york times     the original version of this article   should hedge funds receive special treatment    is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      by executive order  president obama has made a few minor changes to the student loan industry designed to help students and former students with unmanageable student loan debt  anyone who began their undergraduate studies in   probably did so with the reasonable assumption that they’d have a job after graduation  by the time these students graduated with bachelors’ degrees  the economic situation offered a different reality  the unemployment rate for americans between the ages of   and   as of september   was      according to the bureau of labor statistics     last year  the total amount of  student loan debt surpassed credit card debt  for the first time  student loans and the value of an education is now such a popular debate that it sparked a discussion at dinner last night with several colleagues  with tuition costs rising much faster than inflation  the only financially responsible path to take is for a family to carefully consider  whether the expense of college is worth the benefit   if the only benefit is perceived in terms of financial return on investment  roi   it can be very difficult in many cases to justify private school tuition       one liberal arts graduate at the table pointed out that there is more to gain from education than immediate high salaries  and this is something that i’ve discussed recently in terms of  building human capital   the expense of higher education is subject to  maslow’s hierarchy of needs   while citizens of the united states often consider higher education as a right  it is a privilege  while everyone should go to college  or at least have the opportunity to do so  being able to afford a school that matches any student’s skills and desires can be beyond financial reach      it is possible to earn a degree without going into debt   but when part of the american dream is providing every opportunity for our children to succeed without barriers  finances often don’t stand in the way  to make those dreams happen  someone often needs to sacrifice the future  today  former students are sacrificing their financial well being for the opportunity to have completed their degree at their preferred institution     last year  congress agreed to some changes to the student loan industry to help students and former students struggling with student loan debt  and obama’s “pay as you earn” plan expands on these benefits  for students with federal student loans  not private loans  with at least one loan borrowed directly from the government and one borrowed from a bank         in    borrowers will be able to reduce their monthly payments from    to    of their discretionary spending  the original law waited until   to make this change     in    borrowers will be able to forgive the balance of their loans after   years of faithful payments  up from   years  last year’s law would have put this into effect in       student loan consolidation will return  allowing current and recent students to save up to   basis points on their loans        the student loan industry is dysfunctional  the availability of student loans makes it possible for colleges and universities to raise tuition without significantly affecting demand  by not solving the problem of rising tuition prices  the government gives a boost to the organizations  both semi public and private  that finance and underwrite student loans  furthermore  student loan debt is not forgivable in bankruptcy  unlike almost all other forms of debt  in a volatile job market   it’s riskier to have a student loan than it is to have credit card debt      i’d like to have children at some point  and i’d like for them to have the opportunity to attend college  i would not like for them to need to sacrifice a significant portion of their future in order for them to receive the education that’s best for them  at this rate in two decades  a college education at a private school will be unaffordable for middle class families without student loan debt that requires a lifetime of servitude      photo   joshberglund      bureau of labor statistics    cbs news    new york times     the original version of this article   obama’s student loan plan   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      as i’ve pointed out recently  banking customers have grown accustomed to the concept of free checking  thanks to profits in the banking industry from a variety of sources  banks could justify offering checking account services  including debit cards  without charging any fees  the industry has changed over the past year  and many banks  particularly large financial institutions  are finding ways to earn more money from depositors     only a few banks remain that offer competitive interest rates — and in today’s environment these rates are nothing exciting — without charging oversized fees  for a limited time  everbank is attracting new customers with a    cash bonus after opening a  yield pledge checking account         the amount of    has become a special number recently  bank of america’s new debit card fee is    per month  or    annually  everbank has devised the clever idea that turning the    from a fee to a benefit might be a good way to attract customers  whether you consider it a gimmick or not  free money can help anyone      everbank has some requirements for new customers wishing to earn the    cash bonus  the bank doesn’t give    to every new customer  those seeking the bonus will need to be aware of the bank’s conditions for qualification        the  yield pledge checking account  must be opened by  november       with an initial deposit of at least          new customers must establish a repeating direct deposit of at least    before january          accounts must have an average daily balance of      for statement periods ending december      and january          the account must remain open until february             for any new customer who meets the above conditions  everbank will deposit the    cash bonus into the account on or before february       furthermore  if you use your yield pledge checking account and are not satisfied after three months and one successful bill payment  everbank will give you        as an added bonus unrelated to the special promotional offer  everbank will reimburse users for all atm fees  regardless of whether the atm is included within the everbank network  there is no maximum to this reimbursement as long as everbank believes the reimbursement requests are legitimate     everbank yield pledge checking account rates             	   		  account balance   interest rate  apy    	         	   		                         	   	   		                       	   	   		                       	   	   		                       	   	   		       or less          	              everbank is not as well known as many other banks because they don’t advertise often  the bank has over    billion in assets  so even if the bank is not popular  it is sizable  there is no monthly account maintenance fee for the yield pledge checking account  if the latest offer interests you  sign up for an  everbank checking account  and earn the    cash bonus before the offer expires on november          the original version of this article   everbank checking account offering    cash limited time bonus   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      steve jobs may not have been as wealthy as his arch nemesis bill gates  but after his successes with apple and pixar  he was one of the world’s richest men  forbes recently listed jobs as  th on the forbes    a list of the richest people in america  with a net worth of    billion  the author of jobs’ biography has been offering some insight into the billionaire’s life in advance of the book’s release  some of the insight pertains to his attitude towards being rich     as success came to jobs and his colleagues  he observed the effect of the influx of wealth after apple became a public company  an excess of money turned those who benefited from the company stock into “bizarro people” who purchased unnecessary things like rolls royces and plastic surgery  jobs said he wanted to avoid “that nutso lavish lifestyle ” although he could afford to upgrade his lifestyle  jobs lived with his family in a modest house in palo alto and didn’t hire help or an entourage      jobs was’t a complete stranger to living a finer life than most of the country could afford  he owned an apartment in the san remo  a building in new york that featured residents including steven spielberg  steve martin  and bono  steve also owned a     square foot mansion in california  while he didn’t own a rolls royce  he drove a   mercedes sl   amg     if steve jobs gave to charitable causes  he didn’t want anyone to know  there is virtually no record of jobs sharing his wealth with causes needing funding  unlike many of the other billionaires outranking him  his direction for the posthumous distribution of his wealth is not public information  while many have criticized jobs for not being a philanthropic role model  using his wealth to inspire others to focus on worthy causes  those with opposing viewpoints argue that his work building a successful company  creating wealth for others as well as revolutionary technology that  among other things  facilitate larger and faster contributions to these worthy causes  has done enough to improve the world      it’s a weak argument  but it’s one that caters to the more capitalistic approach to philanthropy  it relies on the idea that by providing salaries to his employees  they will go out and accomplish the philanthropic goals that jobs did not set for himself  the argument assumes that organizations using iphones  ipads  and macbooks to collect funds wouldn’t have been just as capable with other devices  furthermore  the argument ignores that jobs shut down corporate philanthropy on his return to apple in order to save money  did reducing charitable expenses play a significant role in saving the company     despite some fancy homes that often went unused and a moderately flashy car  jobs seems to have taken the ideology of   the millionaire next door   to heart  he continued to live his life mostly as he always had  not flaunting his wealth and not drawing too much attention to himself outside of his job responsibilities  for someone whose motto and company marketing slogan was “think different ” jobs appeared to desire to keep his differences unseen       the millionaire next door  changed the way people think about millionaires  most millionaires worked hard building a company to earn money  they didn’t earn it  they tend to blend in with their surroundings  not flaunt their wealth  those who buy items as status symbols tend not to be wealthy  purchasing items on credit  or are wealthy only temporarily due to overspending  this idea of an understated millionaire  comfortable with his wealth and free of a need to prove himself  seems to fit the profile of steve jobs     it’s perhaps an approach that would befit anyone who found himself with any amount of wealth beyond what is needed to afford the necessities of life     photo   annie bannanie       business insider    examiner    forbes    forbes       washington post     the original version of this article   steve jobs  the billionaire next door   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
       your  personal human capital  is an essential part of evaluating your overall worth  human capital has a number of definitions  but in this case  it refers to a measurement of who you are  particularly in relation to how you might be seen as valuable to an employer or a client  this isn’t the only way to define a person  but since it ties directly into your future earnings and your potential net worth  it is related to finance and shouldn’t be ignored  it’s as important  or even more important  than your net worth measurement      consider two job applicants with identical technical skills and education  both pertaining to the job description  and a similar personality that could result in either choice being a good fit for the company  one of the applicants has indicated that he has often been called upon to present information about hie field to the public  having presentation skills can make a prospective employee more attractive to the employer  the ability to eloquently  entertainingly  and comfortably lead a discussion or present information in front of an audience can open opportunities     anyone can throw together a powerpoint presentation together  but delivering that presentation isn’t as easy as reading the bullet points  anyone can write a speech  but elocution is a skill that requires careful honing      most people in “business” head directly to toastmasters  toastmasters uses a standardized curriculum and a safe practice environment that allows people to receive the education and experience they need to take their presenting skills to the next level  my former company  at the satellite location where i worked  had an internal toastmasters group  we met once every two weeks to critique each other’s speeches or presentations and gain experience speaking extemporaneously about random topics assigned in the moment     outside of toastmasters  you can gain experience speaking and presenting by organizing an event in your community  libraries offer these opportunities as do community centers and religious organizations  if your field of interest holds conferences  try to get on the schedule of speakers      public speaking is acting and performing    stage fright is a common barrier to increasing public speaking experience  there are two keys to overcoming stage fright or performance anxiety  being overly prepared and breathing properly  even though the solution is simple  it isn’t always easy  even veteran actors deal with stage fright  so it isn’t something that is easily cured even it can be managed  acting experience can be beneficial for public speaking  as many of the skills are similar  in addition to acting  any kind of performance experience — music  dance  etc  — can have positive effects on confidence and the ability to successfully deliver a speech     acting also helps develop a performer’s presence  if you’re speaking publicly  you’ll need to have a presence that’s informative and trusted  the best speakers are sometimes described as “larger than life ” you know when they walk into a room that whatever they have to say will be worth hearing     actors develop emotional communication skills  without saying a word  an actor can convey an emotion  the audience will be able to understand what the actor is thinking or feeling  skilled actors can transmit those emotions to the audience  so the spectators can sympathetically feel what the actor is feeling  this is an invaluable skill for speakers  it could mean the difference between a good presentation and a speech that has the audience on the edge of their seats      how do you suggest gaining public speaking experience      the original version of this article   boost your human capital  public speaking   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      if you want to know how much credit card debt americans have  don’t ask the borrowers  for years  economists have sought debt data from both borrowers and lenders for credit card debt and four other debt categories  borrowers report their debt balances by responding to household surveys  like the survey of consumer finances  lenders report debt to the credit reporting bureaus such as equifax      relying on self reported information for studies is always a risky approach if you’re planning to make any scientific assumptions based on the data  everybody lies  or  in some cases  people think they know the answer to a question about how or why they do something  but the truth remain undetected  asking a population of consumers  if they will transfer all their money from a big bank to a credit union  will always result in overstating the number  as people tend to respond as if they were their ideal versions of themselves  surely  a quantifiable question such as their debt balances shouldn’t be subject to this kind of error     in fact  for most types of credit card debt  the self reported balances match the issuer reported balances  in only one category is there a discrepancy  credit cards     binyamin applebaum from the economix blog explores some of the possible reasons that consumers misreport credit card debt  among the possibilities     shame    most of the other debt categories reported  such as student loans and home mortgages  tend to be socially acceptable  a consumer who feels embarrassed about a behavior or a state of being  there’s a chance he or she will be less willing to report it on a survey  personal bankruptcies  on the other hand  could also be embarrassing  but households report them correctly     ignorance     the study comparing the two debt reporting approaches show that single people report their credit card accurately while households do not  household surveys are generally answered by only one person within the household  and that person may not be aware of the other person’s debt  even if the family has chosen to combine accounts      interpretation     if someone were to ask me how much credit card debt i have  i’d say i have none  my  latest balance sheet   net worth report  shows that is false  at the end of each month  i have a balance on my credit cards  i pay my credit card balance in full every month before it is due  but a snapshot on any date would show that i have a balance  people like me might report that they have no credit card debt  particularly if the question is not explained well on the survey  the issuers see it differently  they report a balance to the credit bureaus even if the issuers expect  or would expect if they note patterns  the borrower to pay in full     when correcting for these issues  the researchers who conducted the study comparing the two reporting techniques still couldn’t explain the remaining discrepancy  issuers reported more than twice the amount of credit card debt borrowers reported  the only possible conclusion is that people just don’t know how much they owe on credit cards  the study concludes that “uninformedness” is the problem  people just don’t know how much credit card debt they have  even if statements make this information easily accessible  at least on a monthly basis     two important steps in taking control of your finances are to  take an inventory   finding where you stand in every financial account including debt  and to  track your money   knowing how much is coming in and going out  and when these changes happen      do you know how much credit card debt you have  do you think it matches what your credit card issuers say you have       federal reserve bank of new york   pdf  via  economix     the original version of this article   under reporting personal household debt   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      almost ten years ago  the government passed a law that made electronic images of paper checks just as legitimate as the paper checks themselves  as banks implemented the law  it saved time and money by allowing banks of first deposit to scan checks after a customers deposit them for verification with the originating bank  with an image of a check being accepted in place of a paper check  more banks have begun implementing a convenience to customers as well     businesses were the first customers to receive these benefits  for a business that receives thousands of checks every day  bringing the physical paper checks to a branch for deposit can be an expensive and time consuming process  fraught with the possibility of security problems with the checks in transit  banks have offered business the option of remote deposit  with this service  the customer can scan checks using a specialized imagine device  check scanner  and transmit the images securely over the internet or a private network connection  the funds are then available immediately rather than overnight      with this success  banks are in the process of extended similar features to non business customers  with the proliferation of cell phones with built in  high megapixel camera  banks can now offer deposits using snapshots of checks sent via text message or custom smartphone apps  for these customers  no bulky desktop scanner is necessary  and there’s no need to be home to make the deposit  you can effectively deposit checks from your mailbox down the street or from your grandmother’s house on your birthday      business customers still have the advantages  with very few banks actively offering this service to non business customers  the number of banks offering this service to consumers is increasing  however     remote deposit is most useful for banks that don’t have local branches  like  these online banks   ing direct  still bloggers’  most favorite bank   is working to implement remote check deposit soon  but with the bank’s planned acquisition by capital one it’s unclear when new features will be added   ing direct recently began offering paper checks  to customers  so remote deposit capture may not be too far behind      chase bank  offers apps for ios and android devices  the application allows customers to log into their bank accounts  to deposit a check  take a picture of the front and back  and send the images securely to chase using the application  the deposit will be recorded as pending immediately  though availability will depend on the bank’s typical schedule  usually next business day availability for local checks  the availability schedule has several variables  though  so always check with the bank to determine when the funds you deposit will be available      ally bank  has offered remote deposit for customers since april    but the bank has just recently opened the program to all customers  ally’s echeck deposit service requires a scanner and some manual work  such as inputting the check amount  shouldn’t this be automatically read when scanned   and aligning the images  ally plans to offer a mobile application soon     the usaa bank mobile application for ios  android  and windows phone   includes a feature allowing remote deposit  deposit mobile requires the customer to enter the check amount  take one photo of the front of the check and one photo of the back  and submit the images to the bank through the application  the bank will confirm the deposit amount      have you used your bank’s remote deposit service  if so  what did you think of the experience      the original version of this article   banks offering remote deposit   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      the fourth largest bank in the united states by assets  wells fargo  admitted last week that many of its customers received statements with other customers’ banking information included  in this security breach  those affected might have received a statement with a stranger’s account number  transaction detail  and in some cases  social security number  other affected customers might have had their information compromised  with their details included on other customers’ statements  without their knowledge     wells fargo through its spokesman josh dunn blamed the error on a “malfunctioning printer ”     the biggest threat is that with an account name and number  and a bank’s routing number which is public information  anyone can easily print a check  when presented  if the signature isn’t checked  could result in a withdrawal from the compromised customer’s account  for those whose social security numbers have been shared  the potential fraud could be worse      my first reaction is to encourage customers to turn off paper statements opting instead for online statements only  but that won’t prevent every potential bank error  online statements are much more secure than mailed statements     if you’ve been affected  i would suggest changing your account number at wells fargo  this may be a significant process  particularly if you have direct deposit enabled or automated debits scheduled with outside vendors  it will be worth the effort  however  to ensure the compromised account number is no longer linked to you  if you social security number has been shared with a stranger  you should contact one of the credit reporting bureaus to freeze your credit  your social security number can be used to open accounts in your name  using your credit history  so by working with the credit agencies you can opt to be notified if anyone tries to open a new line of credit      considering wells fargo’s error  the bank should offer to pay for credit monitoring services for affected customers      is this extra motivation for moving your money out of a big bank   there are many reasons to  switch to a credit union   but this may not be a reason on its own  mistakes like this one can happen at any institution  regardless of the company’s size      i’ve used wells fargo for my primary banking services  ever since wells fargo acquired wachovia  since wachovia acquired first union  since first union acquired corestates  since philadelphia national bank merged with new jersey national bank forming corestates financial corporation      if you’re a wells fargo customer  do you plan to close your account after this incident      photo   moneyblognewz     businessweek  ap      the original version of this article   wells fargo sent statements to wrong customers   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article

       money and things have never been important to me    do you agree or disagree with this statement    that is  assuming the statement is about you  the reader  not me  flexo       if you do agree with this statement  according to a new study released by brigham young university and william paterson university  you would be more likely to score highly in measurements of emotional maturity and responsiveness to partners  in other words  less materialistic people are happier in their marriages       according to the study  researchers tend to believe that stress in relationships is a result of each partner having a different attitude toward money  perhaps one side of the relationship is more materialistic than the other side  and this divergence of attitudes would create tension in the relationship  this study  which surveyed     married couples  shows that even when everyone within the relationship has the same attitude towards money — an attitude that emphasizes the importance of money and things — there is a correlation to a lower level of marital happiness or satisfaction     these results can be applied to couples  for a better chance of happiness in a relationship  let go of the focus on money  particularly the idea that the purpose of money is to accumulate objects that reflect a status of some sort      the study further concluded that even if one member of the couple lived by a philosophy not based on the accumulation of material objects  the relationship is better off from a satisfaction standpoint  even if the philosophies differ and the couple would be expected to live in conflict over the philosophical divergence  having just one member willing to look beyond materialism correlates to more marital bliss     regardless of level of income  the correlation continues  couples struggling to make ends meet and couples with financial security are both affected similarly by the state of materialistic attitudes in the relationship  the study also shows that materialistic couples tend to be better off financially  the philosophy may pay off from a strictly financial standpoint  then again  divorces can be costly and could negate any financial advantage gained by approaching life with a focus on buying more stuff     materialism  as measured by this survey  is linked to  ineffective communication with the significant other   increased negative conflict  and decreased satisfaction and stability in the relationship  this isn’t necessarily a cause and effect relationship  the study doesn’t show that materialism  causes  problems in a relationship  but there is a correlation  there could be an outside variable that induces one to be more materialistic and induces one to tend towards negative conflict      is the financial advantage of being overly concerned about money and things worth the risk of being less satisfied in a marriage      photo   seanmcgrath     journal of couple   relationship therapy  via  time     the original version of this article   materialistic people less happy in marriages but have more money   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
      some small business owners find that they can more easily organize their accounting if they have a credit card dedicated to business purchases  for business owners who haven’t established credit in the business’s name  credit card issuers generally rely on the owner’s credit history  so even without a business credit history  it’s possible to be approved  many small business cards are offering up front rewards for signing up  the newest offer on the market is the  citibusiness® world card   offering new account holders a    bonus in the form of points        new customers must spend    on the card during the first three months to qualify for this sin up bonus  when a new cardholder satisfies this requirement  citi will add     thankyou points to his or her account immediately  customers can redeem these points for cash  travel  or    in gift cards  the citi business world card also offers points for every purchase using the following schedule        three thankyou points for every dollar spent on purchases at certain office supply merchants and on professional services     one thankyou point per dollar spent on other purchases        also  business owners who order additional cards for employees will earn thankyou points for the employees’ purchases     unfortunately  the conversion between thankyou points and cash back is not the standard consumers have come to expect  normally  card issuers allow a conversion of   points to one dollar in cash back  the thankyou points convert at that rate when redeeming gift cards  and most customers will find this to be the best use of the points  thankyou points never expire  unlike most citi consumer  non business  cards  there is no limit to the amount of points a business owner can earn each year     one of the strongest benefits of the  citibusiness® world card  is that it functions similarly to a charge card while still maintaining the features of a credit card  the card has no pre set spending limit  so if a customer completes a purchase that causes the account to exceed the stated credit limit  citi may still approve the transaction  without assessing a penalty or fee  if citi does approve a purchase that sends a cardholder over the limit  the issuer allows a full statement cycle to pass to pay the over limit amount before charging interest and fees  it’s the only card i know of that offers this feature  which could come in handy in some situations     citi also provides a    introductory apr on purchases for six months  and after this introductory period  the rate reverts to the standard of      variable  which is considered low in today’s market  with no annual fee  the  citibusiness® world card  is a great option for any business owner looking to make organizing finances a little easier     the original version of this article   citibusiness world card offering    bonus   is copyrighted by  consumerism commentary   if you are reading this elsewhere you may be reading a stolen article                                                                    
                                                      while many of us will reflect on our blessings as we gather with friends or family tomorrow for thanksgiving day  we predict that robert l  hanson’s celebration will be particularly festive     as american eagle outfitters  inc   aeo   announced  last week  the company named hanson as its new chief executive officer and a director  starting january       hanson  who capped a   year career with levi’s by serving as its global president  was chosen to succeed retiring american eagle ceo  jim o’donnell  who  has been in the top job since december        the company filed hanson’s new   year  employment agreement  as an attachment to this    k   which arrived as part of last week’s official “friday night dump ” and – as employment agreements go – this one is no turkey     for starters  hanson gets a signing bonus of      million  to be paid sometime between january   and january       if he doesn’t start when he’s supposed to  or if he leaves within a year or is terminated for cause  he might have to repay the money     the “side dish” terms hanson got are pretty tasty  too  his base salary will start at      million  and hanson agreed that any money exceeding    million will be deposited into his deferred compensation plan each year   that money will vest in thirds over the next three anniversaries of hanson’s start date      american eagle outfitters also promised to give hanson – for fy   only – a long term equity incentive compensation award worth      million  in addition  it’s giving him a restricted stock unit award worth      million and a stock option grant for common stock with a grant date value equal to another      million  both the number of the rsus and the exercise price for the options will be tied to the company’s stock price on the day that hanson reports for work  that’s an extra      million  and – like many a thanksgiving dinner – we haven’t even gotten to the dessert terms yet     also  for fy    his maximum incentive cash bonus will be    of his base salary  however  starting in  fy    “the target incentive bonus shall be    of his base salary and the maximum incentive bonus shall be    of his base salary ”  lucky hanson  here’s another thing for him to be grateful for  we noticed that the   k’s summary differs slightly and states  “…beginning with the    fiscal year   the target incentive bonus shall be    of his base salary and the maximum bonus shall be    of his base salary…”   emphasis added to highlight the year    it doesn’t really matter which document is “correct” since the signed contract trumps the summary any day of the week  those are the terms that a court would enforce      hanson will also get up to      in legal fees  “a single luxury automobile for both business and personal use”  alas  it’s not giving him a tax gross up on the car   and a relocation package so that he can move to a home “in reasonable proximity” to either the company’s headquarters in pittsburgh  pennsylvania or its new york  new york offices within   months of taking the job  the house hunting clause come with a little extra whipped cream that entitles hanson to take his time and find just the right home  it allows him        “i  travel expenses for up to six     house hunting trips for executive and a companion and  ii  household goods moving expenses  relocation allowances  temporary living expenses  and other relocation costs or expenses to which the parties agree… ”       and finally  the parties also signed a  change in control agreement  that promises hanson severance   x his annual compensation   a pro rated bonus    months’ of benefits under cobra  and accelerated vesting of his equity interests if a change in control occurs     with a new deal worth more than      million  plus whatever bonus he gets  and whatever the relocation ends up costing   hanson will be a busy guy tomorrow when he counts his blessings… or at least his new compensation package      image source    hildgrim  via flickr     data source   morningstar document research    ——       here at footnoted  we’re thankful for our loyal readers  we

                                                          a few weeks ago  we  footnoted  the generous pay package that robert “bob” pittman snagged by taking the chief executive’s job at cc media holdings  ccmo   the parent company of the clear channel broadcasting and advertising businesses  pittman had been a muckety at the company formerly known as aol time warner  and his new employer promised  among other perks  to “make an aircraft  which  to the extent available  will be a dassault breguet mystere falcon    available to mr  pittman for his business and personal use ” at company expense     well  clear channel filed another    k  just after     p m  friday  toward the early end of the weekly friday night dump  that suggests the deal is even sweeter than it first seemed  it looks like pittman isn’t just getting free jet rides — he’s getting paid    million for the privilege of riding around in  his own  fancy jet     see  it turns out that pittman  as busy as he undoubtedly is  has enough time to run an aircraft leasing operation  a major customer  perhaps its only customer   is clear channel broadcasting  a wholly owned unit of clear channel media holdings  given the terms laid out in the filing  of course  this aircraft leasing business doesn’t seem too demanding  clear channel has agreed to pay    million up front  will “obtain insurance policies covering all operations of the aircraft at ccb’s sole cost and expense ” and on top of that  is taking on       “all taxes or fees which may be assessed or levied as a result of the leasing or operation of the aircraft … ccb will be responsible for all costs of operating and maintaining the aircraft during the term  as defined below   other than discretionary upgrades  capital improvements or refurbishment   ccmh intends to make the aircraft available to mr  pittman for his business and personal use pursuant to the terms of his previously disclosed employment agreement with ccmh ”       and there you go  the company promised to let him tool around in a corporate jet for both business and personal travel  and it will be his  own  fancy jet  and the company will pay him    million to lease the jet from him  so that he can fly around in it   got that      clearly pittman has an eye for irony  in addition to fine corporate aircraft and convoluted related party transactions  because he dubbed his leasing company yet again inc  we’re all for serial entrepreneurship  and we like cute names as much as the next person  but at a certain point  isn’t it just rubbing it in     in a generous gesture  incidentally  pittman has graciously agreed to return some of that    million if the arrangement should be canceled before its six year term expires     you can see the  faa record  of pittman’s plane  and more  including a photo of the jet itself  from  www airport data com   of course  the wsj jet tracker lists  where it’s been   and how often  from   through last year — we see nearly two dozen trips to telluride  and of course a bunch of pleasant  stylish and or sunny locales  including paris  seven times   montego bay in jamaica    times   las vegas    times   and even a lone trip to the  netherlands antilles   from jamaica  in fact      we should also note that  after we spotted the filing on friday  we discovered that a couple of folks had also noticed the document  a tip of the hat to  radio info com   which credited the tri newsletter in a post yesterday     when pittman talked to  dealbook  last month  he observed that he had been able to take the chairman’s job for a while before accepting the ceo position  and said  “this is one of those companies where the closer you looked  the better it seemed ”    from his perspective  anyway  there’s no arguing

                                                      since medco health solutions  inc   mhs  and express scripts  inc   esrx  announced their intentions this past june to combine forces in a       billion merger   the top dogs at both companies have been busy  lobbying congress  and officials at a host of federal agencies to convince them that the deal  won’t  violate antitrust laws and that it  will  be good for consumers  but the  merger proxy  that medco filed on friday convinced us of a different point  its named executive officers will get multi million dollar payouts if the merger goes through and they subsequently lose their jobs     the disclosures come in the “golden parachute compensation” section of the filing  on page    just in case you didn’t make it that far  the numbers used are just an estimate  based on the hypothetical scenario that the merger had been approved  and that medco’s named executive officers had been terminated on october          medco’s chairman and ceo  david b  snow  jr   stands to gain more than      million if he is terminated within a year after the merger closes  of that sum       million would be paid as cash severance and more than      million for snow’s equity interests     other top executives would also get nice payouts  president and chief operating officer  kenneth o  klepper stands to get more than       million  senior vice president  finance and cfo  richard j  rubino  could receive nearly      million  general counsel  secretary and president  global pharmaceutical strategies  thomas m  moriarty  could get more than      million  and group president  employer key accounts  timothy c  wentworth  may receive more than      million     but whereas snow’s entitlement to the money  per his employment agreement  is conditioned upon the merger closing and him being terminated within a year  the other four executives’ rights come from the change in control severance plan  thus  they are protected if a qualifying termination occurs within  two years  following the medco merger     these numbers could “materially differ” from amounts that may actually be paid  but – based on the explanation in the merger proxy – it seems far more likely that the payout numbers would go up  not down        “the amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur  including assumptions described in this joint proxy statement prospectus  and do not reflect certain compensation actions occurring before completion of the medco merger  such as the grant of stock options and rsus in respect of   performance and payment of   bonuses … ”       express scripts and medco are independently holding special shareholders’ meetings at the same time on december    and it remains to be seen whether their shareholders will approve the deal  the filing also disclosed that both companies are currently working on their responses to the federal trade commission’s request for additional information and documentary material  after that  the doj  the ftc  state attorneys general  and possibly others could file suit to block or restrict the merger  but it seems clear that medco’s top executives don’t have to worry about missing their mortgage payments if the merger goes through and they subsequently find themselves out of work     meanwhile  medco employees continue to have questions about the deal  judging by  this   k  that the company filed late friday  one of the first questions had to do with which executives plan to stick around post deal  we thought the answer  which of course relates to the pay outs  was worth including here      “the complete and extended leadership team for the new organization is still under review and has not been decided  medco’s senior executives remain committed to ensuring the merger is completed and that the transition positions the new entity for its continuing success ”     suffice it to say that that sounds like a lot of fancy words to not really answer the question on whether the executives are staying or leaving      image source    e magineart com      data source    morningstar document research     ——

                                                      on wednesday  sonya  footnoted  the sudden departure of automated data processing  adp  chief executive gary c  butler  effective november    while the suddenness seemed a bit unusual to us  adp  cast this  as part of a “succession plan previously established ” so we didn’t really question the timing  today  we learned that he had been arrested on a criminal domestic violence charge in the days before butler stepped down     we got the tip from a reader  who pointed us to a facsimile  booking report  posted on the website of the  beaufort tribune   a local newspaper in beaufort county  south carolina  we put in calls to adp   no response yet    see below     to the numbers we could find for butler  also no response yet   and to the beaufort county sheriff’s office  which confirmed that the butler who was arrested also worked for adp   the picture on the booking report certainly suggested as much  compared to  publicity shots  of the adp executive  but we like to make sure        update     an adp spokesman called back last night while i was flying back from chicago  and we weren’t able to connect until this morning  this is the statement the company just sent a few minutes ago        “on november       gary butler informed the adp board of directors of his decision to retire from the company and resign from the board for personal reasons  the board was aware of the circumstances surrounding his decision and immediately implemented its previously established succession plan  under which carlos rodriguez would become ceo upon mr  butler’s retirement  out of respect for his privacy  adp is not commenting further ”      butler was arrested on november   at what appears to be a  second home  in bluffton  south carolina   adp is based in new jersey  and we understand butler listed a mountain lakes  new jersey  address with police in south carolina   we were told by the sheriff’s office that butler and his wife had argued earlier in the day  and then went out to dinner with friends  that night  after returning home  the argument resumed  according to the police report on file with the sheriff’s office  “at some point mr butler grabbed  his wife  by the neck and by the wrist and pushed her against a bureau in the bedroom  and she fled the residence and called law enforcement ” beaufort county sheriff’s office sgt  robin mcintosh told us  citing the police report  she said butler’s wife didn’t need medical attention  but that officers found signs “of somebody having had their hands on her ”    the sheriff’s office doesn’t have any record of prior incidents involving butler  a hearing in  general sessions court  is scheduled for december       the incident may explain the sudden series of events that led up to butler’s departure  his resignation came on november    the day after he was booked  his resignation was announced the next day —  cast as a retirement  —  and his  separation agreement  was dated november    but retroactive to november        we’ll let you know if we learn more  or hear back from butler or adp      image source    forbes com                                                                                                                                                                   		ad begin  		                                                                                                                                                                       		ad end  		                                                                                                                                            		                                                                		footnotedpro articles begin  		                                                                		   		   		     		  designed for investors who want to dig into the details  but don t have the time     		                                                                		footnotedpro articles end  		                                                                                                                                                                                                                            see more of what’s in the filings  check out   footnotedpro    where we highlight unusual opportunities and potential problems well in advance of the market  for more information or to inquire about a trial subscription  email us at   pro footnoted com       		    		                                                                    
                                                      we’ve joked before that when journalists see three of something  it’s a trend — and two is most of the way to three  so when we saw institutional brokerage and market maker knight capital group  kcg  hand a departing executive millions for the second time in   months  we looked a little more closely     this time  the executive is executive vice president gregory c  voetsch  his departure  as of october    was  announced  november   as part of a broader reshuffling of the company’s various operations  and the press release describes him as having  ”voluntarily resigned his position to pursue other opportunities ” that’s one of the oldest business clichés in the book  of course  but sometimes even clichés can be true  after all     voetsch gets      million in cash to help him along with whatever those opportunities might be  he’s also getting      million more to cash out his unvested restricted stock  and company health insurance for   months  in return  he won’t compete with knight capital for six months and won’t try to poach employees for a year — and he’s promised to avoid badmouthing the company forever  the company can’t diss him in public either  but we were struck by just how specific the limitations are on voetsch  the  agreement  itself spells out        “you agree you shall not issue  authorize  or condone comments or statements to the press concerning knight or any of its parents  affiliates  officers  or vectors other than to say ‘i cannot comment ’ you shall notify knight’s general counsel if you have been contacted by the press or broadcast media        as regular readers might guess by now  this kind of payout doesn’t quite mesh with the proxy’s description of the severance voetsch would ordinarily be eligible for under various scenarios  termination “in a manner which would have made  him  eligible for severance” would have secured him a maximum of   weeks’ salary  or       had he been canned last december    retirement would have accelerated the vesting of some of his restricted stock units  but only to the tune of      million as of the end of    this is how the proxy wraps up the section that describes severance terms for voetsch and others        “other than in respect of accelerated vesting of equity awards as described above  none of the named executive officers are entitled to any compensation or benefits on a voluntary termination of employment  death  or disability that is different than the compensation and benefits provided to company employees generally  “       amusingly  as is so often the case  the agreement also includes detailed prohibitions on disclosing its terms — so specific that it creates a explicit exception allowing voetsch to “discuss this agreement and release with your spouse …  and  your attorneys…”  among others  never mind that the company would be filing the document with the securities and exchange commission for all to see     as we mentioned  voetsch isn’t the first knight executive to get big bucks on the way out  in august of last year  sonya  footnoted  the departure of gary katcher  who had joined the company a couple years before with its acquisition of boutique bond brokerage libertas holdings  he got      million cash  and was also cashed out of     restricted shares — and knight capital promised to invest up to      million in a hedge fund created by katcher within two years     given that neither side is supposed to say much of anything  this filing is likely to be the last word we have on the subject  at least until the company’s next proxy comes out  detailing payments made to executives this year  maybe then we’ll also find out what happened with the      million that knight promised to invest with katcher last august      image source    wwarby  via flickr     data source    morningstar document research     ————     see more of what’s in the filings  check out  footnotedpro   where we

                                                      tucking into the    k  that automatic data processing  inc   adp  filed yesterday was a little like digging into a nice  tasty slice of pineapple upside  down cake  why  you ask  well – as with the cake – it turns out that some of the most interesting ingredients in the attachment to the regulatory filing were baked further down in the document  most notably  on page       the attachment in question  exhibit      is a november    separation agreement  that adp gave to longtime president  ceo  and director  gary c  butler  who  retired  on november   after a   year career with the company     we had to read all the way down to    q  to find out that adp will pay butler      million in january     as well as another      within   days of the agreement to compensate him for his fy   bonus   based on our experience  it’s pretty unusual for a company not to summarize the terms in the body of the   k and then leave the details to the agreement     another goodie that butler negotiated obligates adp to provide the executive “with appropriate office and secretarial support until butler’s  nd birthday  which office will not  in any event  be located in an adp facility ” butler is   now  according to adp’s press release  so this benefit could last for another   years  the company also agreed to transfer title to the leased company car that butler has been driving  the company estimated the value of these benefits to be worth      in its september    proxy   which seems like some pretty swank office space     and there are other interesting terms  as well  for example  all of butler’s unvested stock options became vested on the day he resigned  according to the proxy  butler’s vested and unvested stock options were worth nearly      million  that number assumes that unvested options had vested immediately and were exercised on june        this is a big deal  because had the accelerated vesting not occurred  butler’s options would have vested in leisurely    increments over five years  starting a year after their grant date  the company also gave butler the fy   target grant amount of     shares of common stock under the performance based restricted stock program  at yesterday’s closing price of       that could be worth more than      million     in all  the proxy showed that if butler had retired on june       he stood to collect nearly      million from his equity interests  supplemental retirement plan  deferred compensation account  health coverage  and the perks  the office  assistant’s salary  and car   but as far as we can tell  the      million that the separation agreement promises to pay butler is money in addition to the figure from the proxy  think of them as a few extra cherries sprinkled on top of what he was already set to receive     we know that butler’s retirement was expected at some point  and adp already had a succession plan in place  at the same time that butler retired  the company promoted chief operating officer carlos a  rodriguez to serve in the top executive post     and we should point out that butler’s tenure at adp was profitable  a point that company chairman leslie brun made in this dow jones newswire  article  on november    brun stated  “since he became ceo in    revenues and profits have both increased significantly and the company is well positioned to continue its profitable growth ” with that being the case  perhaps shareholders won’t begrudge butler a few extra bites on his way out the door      image source    kimberlykv  via

                                                      they say it’s only a game  but for a bunch of publicly traded companies  basketball means business — and the lockout and labor turmoil in the national basketball association means bad news     the nba’s season is in shambles after a lockout by owners this summer dragged on and talks faltered   nba officials canceled games through november    yesterday  the nba players’ union  said it would disband   paving the way for an antitrust lawsuit against the owners — and raising the specter of a longer  messier fight     given the circumstances  some companies’ disclosures are no brainers   madison square garden  msg   owns the nba’s new york knicks  and notes at one point in the    q  it filed earlier this month that its nba and national hockey league teams together mean the company earns “a disproportionate share of its revenues” while those sports are in season  in a section on events after the end of the quarter  the company warns that failing to reschedule the games canceled so far would hurt the company’s fiscal second quarter results  and that further cancelations “could have a material negative effect on our   fiscal year results ”  moreover  the impact of any new revenue sharing agreement adopted by the nba after an agreement is reached  assuming one is  of course   is bound to affect the company as well  for better or worse      time warner  twx   says the lockout didn’t have a material impact on the most recent quarter’s results  and optimistically predicts that it “ does not expect it to have a material impact on the segment’s operating results for the remainder of the year ” not that all’s necessarily well  as its    q  goes on to warn         “however  the longer term impact of the nba lockout will be influenced by many factors including viewer ratings on tnt and advertising demand after the nba lockout ends  because of the inherent uncertainties surrounding the nba lockout  the company is unable to quantify the adverse impact that a prolonged nba lockout would have on the networks segment s operating results ”       others more peripheral to the off court action  and all too soon  perhaps  the in court legal action  tend to be less detailed in their warnings  buffalo wild wings  bwld   the chicken wing restaurant chain  simply warned in the    q  that it filed on november   that “our sales may be negatively affected by a disruption in the viewing of sporting events in our restaurants such as nfl  mlb  nba  and nhl due to strikes  lockouts  or labor disputes ”     take two

adverse impact on our business and operating results ” it continued        “the nba players union and the owners of the nba teams are currently renegotiating their collective bargaining agreement  which expired following the     basketball season  sales of  k’s annually released basketball game could be adversely affected due to the players being locked out and the reduction in the number of games in  or cancellation of  the     basketball season ”       some companies are less explicit about the potential for harm than others  video game maker  electronic arts  erts   also has contracts with the nba  presumably for its  nba jam  games   yet when it filed its    q  the same day as take two  it didn’t say anything about the lockout  of course  size may make a difference here  electronic arts is more than six times as big as take two  by market cap     as with so many things tied to the basketball dispute  how big a deal it all turns out to be depends on how long things

                                                      while none of the footnoted staff lives in ohio  we suspect that it’s a lot like everywhere else  there are wonderful qualities and opportunities that make life  enjoyable   and there are also challenges to living there  but the prospect of moving from atlanta to ohio was too much for a second top executive at the wendy’s co   wen   prompting him to resign while leaving with several million dollars   we wrote a  post  last may about wendy’s first ohio related resignation      the departure of roland smith  the company’s president and ceo  was actually announced in a two sentence section of an    k  filed september    the rest of the filing introduced smith’s successor  emil brolick  and disclosed the terms of brolick’s  employment agreement  and  deferred compensation plan   the subject of this september  post    what was clearly missing  though  was any explanation for smith’s exit or a disclosure of what the company might pay him on his way out the door     we now have the answers to those questions  thanks to the    q  and attachments that wendy’s filed with the sec on november    you may recall that – until recently – arby’s  headquartered in atlanta  used to be part of wendy’s  but once arby’s was sold  wendy’s didn’t need the atlanta base  the company decreed that all of its top executives would be based in dublin  ohio     smith sent the company a couple of letters  including this september   letter attached as an  exhibit  to the   q  after referring to his  december    employment agreement   smith then explained that he didn’t want to move to ohio  and that the company’s request that he do so breached a promise in his employment agreement  specifically  that the company wouldn’t “without your consent   require you to relocate  to a work situs not in the atlanta  georgia greater metropolitan area”   here’s a snippet from the exhibit        “this letter agreement supplements my earlier letter agreement with the company dated july      regarding the relocation of the company’s headquarters and the occurrence of a “triggering event” under the terms of the employment letter agreement  this letter agreement is being delivered in connection with the offer of employment made recently by the company to a candidate to assume the position of chief executive officer of the company  with such employment to commence on or about september      ”       we can’t tell you what the july   letter says because it was never filed with the sec  however  it’s clear that the company knew that smith’s resignation was coming  since brolick’s arrival and the announcement of smith’s departure occurred simultaneously  and the   q itself has a brief section at the bottom of page   which disclosed that         “…in accordance with the termination provisions of  smith s  related employment agreement  the companies incurred termination costs of          principally for required payments of          and vesting of previously issued stock awards of              in the third quarter of   ”        don’t be fooled  though  those figures are “in thousands except per share amounts ” so we’re really talking about millions here     although smith officially ceased serving as the ceo and president on september    he is still working as a “special advisor” and director until december       smith’s letter confirms his arrangement with wendy’s  he would “provide advice and counsel as requested ” and the company would continue to pay him “at the same compensation level  including without limitation salary  bonus and employee benefits ”  the april     proxy  revealed that smith’s base salary was      million  on top of which he received a bonus and equity awards that bumped his total compensation up to more than      million  thus  he is set to earn quite a bit more before he and wendy’s part ways at the end of the year     but don’t despair  ohioans  despite the fact that some of wendy’s executives don’t want to live in your state  we know that any place that inspired leonard bernstein and company to write “ohio”  from the musical “ wonderful town”   must be a very nice place indeed      image source    bearclau  via flickr    ——      do you want help finding the most important disclosures in sec filings  then check out a subscription to  footnotedpro   where

                                                          we’ve observed before that the lawyers drafting securities and exchange commission filings can be a little slow to adopt the latest trends  or adapt to the latest cultural developments — see our january  post  on wikileaks in the filings  for example  or michelle’s look at  “double dip” fears  in september last year  so when something starts cropping up in the filings  you know it has truly arrived  at least on some level     and so it is with  occupy wall street   the quirky demonstration against corporate misdeeds  greed and inequality that has spawned  parallel protests  and spoofs across the country  as well as a bunch of smart  and not so smart  signs   the funniest moment so far  as brought to us by the canadian broadcasting corporation  occupy whitehorse has become a “ virtual occupation ” with the onset of winter — propane doesn’t come cheap  after all      as far as we can tell  occupy wall street made its sec filing debut yesterday  at least by name  in two separate filings  the first  in an    k  from strategic hotels  amp  resorts  bee  — a    million market cap real estate investment trust that concentrates on luxury hotels — landed on the sec’s virtual desk a few minutes before noon  more on them in a moment     the second instance came not two hours later  when cme group  cme  filed its    q   cme group  of course  runs the chicago mercantile exchange  the chicago board of trade and the new york mercantile exchange  so it’s not surprising that it would take a dim view of the protests in new york’s financial district and see itself as a potential target of any nefarious foes of the financial system     in disclosing a new risk factor for investors to consider  the company warns that “our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks ” it continues      “in connection with the continued economic uncertainty  groups such as occupy wall street and anonymous  have targeted the financial services industry as part of their protest against the perceived lax regulation of the financial sector and economic inequality ”     the filing then goes on to explain how  anonymous  – the online organization perhaps best known for retaliating against businesses that cut off financial and other support for  wikileaks  – “called on its supporters to launch a ‘distributed denial of service’ attack to overwhelm website traffic on nyse euronext’s external web site ” succeeding in causing a “brief outage ” the disclosure concludes      “while we have no evidence at this time that we are a specific target of a cyber attack  our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk ”     we’re not sure if cme really means to lump occupy wall street together with anonymous so indiscriminately  or if it’s a kind of rhetorical sleight of hand  for our part  we haven’t heard of any occupy wall street linked cyber attacks — beyond suggestions that anonymous members supporting the movement might try to hack the new york stock exchange — and to our eye the two groups seem pretty different  except perhaps for a penchant for pseudo revolutionary sloganeering and a generally anti corporatist attitude     strategic hotels seems to have had a more practical and indirect reason for addressing occupy wall street  and did so in response to an analyst’s question  in an accompanying  transcript   of the company’s quarterly results  enrique torres  an analyst with green street advisors  asks         “laurence  if i look at the headlines  i see a lot of corporations having now to balance between some job cuts and then their budgets for rewards spending  in addition  you also see the occupy wall street headlines  combining these two elements  what do you think the perceived risk is of a revisit or return of the aig effect on corporate luxury spending ”       you’ll recall that american international group   aig  drew buckets of scorn from lawmakers after feting a hundred advisers at a luxury resort in california not long after securing a federal bailout  the backlash led other companies to  rein in  their own travel and entertainment efforts — at least for a little while  it looks like even  aig is back at it   according to bloomberg news   strategic hotels’ chief executive  laurence geller  says he’s heard “no noise about it  no rumblings” either “politically” or “at the corporate level ” companies are being a little more careful about appearances  but geller suggests it’s not a problem        “it’s got to do with prudence  given the headlines  so instead of a divisional president making his decision  it may need a signature from a group cfo or group coo  for example  but that has had no negative impact on it at all ”       in any case  the two filings mark a milestone of sorts  both for occupy wall street and for the sec      image source    tony the misfit  via flickr     data

    i have to hand it to my credit union   their marketing is pretty good   they advertised an unsecured loan special  good through today  at rates starting at      for up to   months for amounts between    and        it ends today presumably so that people can have the money in hand to shop black friday   the term is no more than   months so that it’s a sure thing that it will be paid off before the holidays next year      everybody’s looking for business — even banks and credit unions     black friday  the quasi official start of the holiday shopping season  has taken on a life of its own the past few years with door buster deals  super early openings  lines around the building  hot chocolate for diehards  “leaked” circulars weeks prior  and much more   with the economy not really recovering with bells on  retailers are needing more than ever to capitalize on tradition     the same is true for banks and credit unions   despite all of the bad press that banks have gotten for raising their fees  loans are their bread and butter   and like retailers  they occasionally run promotions to encourage more business    the rate i got on  my used car loan  was a promotional rate  and it’s pretty hard to beat       handle with care      i’m not debt free   i do have an auto loan out there now   although i would have preferred to pay   cash for the vehicle  we do plan to retire this auto loan ahead of schedule  and the total interest paid won’t exceed    of the loan amount in any case    like i said  it was a great loan    all in all  if we had to take out a loan  this was the best way to do it     borrowing money to spend on holiday presents is a bit different  though   it’s  so  easy to overspend during the holidays  and it’s tough to find things that don’t depreciate heavily after you buy them  especially from retailers    so the      is gone  and then it’s    per month for   months  and that lasts the whole year    a lot of the presents bought with that money have probably worn out their welcome by march at the latest — maybe new year’s eve      everyone wants to sell you a bargain   it’s certainly a good deal for the person selling you the bargain  especially this time of year     it’s up to you to determine whether the bargain is a good deal for you    sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     a surprise calculation  prosper com vs  ing    two ways to pay down a mortgage up front  which is better     an interesting fixed rate mortgage    has black friday jumped the shark     we’re probably going to miss black friday       
    fixed rate mortgages are almost as cheap as the teaser rates on adjustable rate mortgages of a few years ago   the average rate on a   year fixed rate mortgage for today  november  th     stands at         note  it was at the time i wrote this post   rates change all the time    rates haven’t been this low in at least fifty years   some new car financing isn’t this low  and the terms on new car loans aren’t anywhere near   years     why are rates going further in the basement   a few reasons         it’s harder to find qualifying borrowers    a lot of people are living  life after foreclosure  and just flat out don’t qualify for a mortgage  let alone a mortgage at the best rates available      banks are lending less    this is related to the search for qualifying borrowers  but from the supply side of the equation   banks on the whole are gun shy after the bath that they took when housing crashed      the economy is still below par    unemployment is still north of      it was under    four years ago        let’s say that i got a   year fixed rate mortgage five years ago  when the rate was about        on a      loan  my payment would have been        after five years i’d owe almost exactly          if i refinanced the remaining      at a   year  fixed rate mortgage  of    — which is the going rate  —  my payment would go up only by    per month  and i’d shave a full ten years off of my mortgage      i didn’t think rates would get still better from this year’s lows  but i was wrong   if you haven’t refinanced in a while and your credit is sparkly shiny  run some numbers and give it some serious thought   these are crazy  low mortgage rates     sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts       year fixed mortgage rates are below       a   year fixed rate mortgage is protection money    comparing fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages    snapping arm defeat out of the fixed rate jaws of victory    when does it make sense to refinance your mortgage        
    our new  to us  car is now in our driveway   pretty much everything is settled with this vehicle  and we sold the old one that had the broken transmission   we continued “ money lessons for kids ” with our daughter by showing her a few — ok  two dozen —    bills and a cashier’s check with a bunch of zeroes on it     we had the opportunity to negotiate a couple of times during these transactions   we got some of what we wanted in both cases      negotiation opportunity       we bought our new used car from carmax   overall this was a great experience   there was one little hiccup at the end  when we went out to pay off our financing with carmax  which they allow within three business days without paying a dime in interest  neither one of us caught that i had to sign the cashier’s check    the big one  with a bunch of zeroes    we were halfway home when my wife got a call on her cell phone asking us to come back   going back would set us back an hour in driving time alone   i suppose i should have caught that i needed to endorse the check  but i do this once every few years  and they do it dozens of times every day     anyway  i went back to the dealership  and when they brought the check back for me to sign  i asked   “any way i can get a voucher for an oil change   this set us back   minutes of driving one way ”    a few minutes later  i walked out with a    gift certificate      negotiation opportunity       our long time mechanic bought our old car after we had it towed to his shop and after he gave the estimates to us to have the transmission fixed   he likes the kind of van we have  except for the transmission   he’s fixed up a few of them and uses them as loaners for customers     he said that it would be well worth it to him to pay    for the van   i’ve had “cash for your junk car” tow away other vehicles of ours for far less than that  so    wasn’t bad at all for a vehicle that needed about      worth of parts and labor to be roadworthy again     my wife was the one who took the title over to him   she asked if the offer could be more if he gave it in store credit    we have no reason to look elsewhere  as we’re quite happy with his service      he bought the van for    in store credit —    more than he offered in cash      store credit is cheap for the store     the connection between these two wins is that we made it clear that store credit was just fine with us   i don’t think that i would have gotten cash back from carmax for my trouble had i asked for it  and i know that we would have gotten less for the van in cash     there are at least three reasons why this make sense         the money is locked up in the business    the business owner keeps their money for now and pays in future goods and services   there’s a small risk that the business could go under and the money would go with it   but if there’s a good relationship and both parties will continue to do business together  then great      store credit is cheaper for the business than an equivalent amount of cash    it’s not going to cost carmax    to give me    worth of service   it’s not going to cost our mechanic    to give us    worth of services   if it does  then they’re working for nothing   this is the same reason why restaurants love giving out soda  “buy two hamburgers and get a medium drink for free ”  the drink costs them about a nickel  but the value to the customer is           you’re on their side with the transaction     indirectly you’re saying “i want to continue doing business with you” when you suggest compensation in store credit   it gives the business that warm  fuzzy feeling         any other opportunities you’ve had to barter in store credit or something similar   did you get more than you thought     sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     how to cash in on food lion’s stimulus deal without a check    a surefire way to get your kids asking you questions about money    a slick atm trick    six great ways to slam the door on your customers    does taking it to the top do any good        
     and no  the answer is  not  to give    week allowance to a six year old      last week our minivan’s transmission bit the dust    thankfully it bit the dust in our driveway    over the next couple of days my wife and i discussed what to do  whether to fix our car  whether to buy a new to us one — buying a new car didn’t enter the picture  — which kind to buy  and how to pay for it     we had a very level headed discussion about the whole matter   i’m glad that  we’ve learned a thing or two  now that we’re approaching our tenth anniversary   at some points in the discussion  when it was getting serious and when we were trying to make sure that we understood each other  our daughter came in to ask this or that  and at first we asked her to let us finish the discussion privately     after we got through that part of the conversation  we called her in to let her know that nothing was wrong and that we needed to think carefully about what to do because it was a lot of money     at some point  either my wife or i made the observation that this topic really wasn’t over her head  or something that we needed to shield her from   we really didn’t have to discuss the financial questions of getting a car privately      so after that point  we involved our daughter in buying the car    my wife took her to carmax and she got to ride in the cars  and tell her which one she liked better and why   but probably the more important part was that she learned that we were going to borrow money to get the car   we explained that we were going to ask our credit union to lend us money to buy the car  and that we had to pay it back or else they’d be able to take the car  because we didn’t really own the car until the loan was paid back     then tonight my daughter asked me  “daddy  why are you getting a loan for the car ”  music to my ears — not necessarily  because  we’re borrowing  but because this is the most advanced money question my daughter has asked about to date   i got to explain some things about investments to her   i explained that we could sell some of our investments to pay for the car  but at this time we didn’t want to   i got to explain the concept of interest to her  and that it wasn’t free to borrow money   i also got to explain the concept of creditworthiness to her  because mommy and daddy pay their bills on time  the bank didn’t charge us much interest on the loan    we got approved for a  very  good rate on our used car loan      it was great to see her asking questions about personal finance    i think the trick was not to hide the family’s personal finance from her     sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     tithing without getting an allowance     getting better deals by giving business    my daughter groks negotiation … kinda    my daughter can earn    on her money for a while    tie allowance to chores or not        
    the federal housing finance agency  fhfa   with the federal national mortgage association  “fannie mae”  and the  federal home loan mortgage corporation   “freddie mac”    today announced  a number of changes to the home affordable refinance program  harp  designed to increase the number of borrowers eligible for refinancing at risk home mortgages     one of the big deals of this new initiative is the removal of the loan to value ratio  ltv  cap on eligible fixed rate mortgages  now  mortgages that qualify for refinancing under the harp have loan to value ratios of    to  well  as high as you’ve gotten yourself into     it surprised me a little that    ltv wasn’t enough  but after doing some math  i can see how ltv of    or more are not out of the question   in miami  for example  inflation adjusted home prices  dropped     from   to the end of last year   if someone took out a  fixed rate mortgage  for most of the purchase price  then the loan to value would be in the neighborhood of    today if the borrower made regular payments against the mortgage     unlike the first  and long time homeowner’s  tax credit   this initiative is almost completely for homeowners in over their heads   the  minimum  ltv ratio is      that’s not underwater but it’s still fairly high leverage   the expanded harp blanket is also targeted at people who are still making their payments  to qualify  there must have been no late payments in the past six months  and no more than one during the past year      is this harp initiative throwing good money after bad      this all makes for good press but guaranteeing loans this far underwater at attractive fixed rates isn’t the kind of move the finance industry would make on its own   under normal circumstances  lenders like  a  to be paid back  and like  b  to get interest that’s commensurate with the risk they’re taking with lending the money   take away the risk of being paid back  and strange things happen  like really low interest rates for highly undercollateralized loans     that’s the lender’s side   but what about the borrower’s side   is it throwing good money after bad to take “the enterprises” up on this offer   if the refinance actually does make things more affordable  yes   pay the sucker down faster now that the payment’s lower  or build up an emergency fund   take advantage of it   the subsidy is there   it won’t be there forever     the economy would recover faster if the institutions and people exhibiting indiscretion were allowed to fail good and hard  but that’s not the way we’re doing it   look into the new harp initiative if you think you could benefit      and even if you’re not underwater  if you haven’t refinanced for a while  you might be pleasantly surprised with the  current mortgage rates      sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     comparing fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages      year fixed mortgage rates are below       when does it make sense to refinance your mortgage       year fixed mortgage rates are below       debt reduction when you’re upside down       
    the alexa toolbar has some interesting headlines come across it   it draws on reddit fairly often   the submitter for  this article  now has about   net votes from describing their experience calling up a representative at a bank to contest their new monthly service fee     it’s clear that the representative could use some education in the making friends and influencing people department  but what is also revealed is a shocking dose of candid insight       … the rep said it wasn’t the bank’s fault  and blamed the government  she said the federal government capped overdraft fees  and so they just “had” to raise these fees to “cover their losses”  …       price controls make everyone worse off in the long run    capping overdraft fees is a form of price control  the price a bank can charge a customer for the privilege of spending more than they’re allowed to in their account   the government got involved as the result of backlash from something or other — people  ask  or even  beg  the government to get involved in matters  — and the profitable “frequent fliers” of the bank customer pool aren’t quite so profitable anymore   so  the bank needs to find ways to make other customers profitable  such as the responsible ones who spend within the confines of their balance     prices like to move freely so they can arrive at the price that’s best for everyone   with controls the price must settle somewhere outside of optimal  and other prices must adjust around the controlled price   like    or    monthly fees where there were none before   overall  there’s not much that we can do about it   we can vote with our feet like the reddit poster did  but even though he made the point that some other banks and credit unions haven’t upped their fees yet  i tend to side with the bank rep       … the rep got a little anxious  too  when my wife asked about the procedure for closing our account  and actually started arguing with my wife  saying that it was pointless to move our money because “other banks and even the credit unions are going to do it too ”  …      whether the additional cost comes in the form of a monthly fee or something else  the cost will show up   the overdraft income was gone with the stroke of a pen  and a whole bunch of yea votes    now we all adjust    sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     was mandatory overdraft privilege such a bad thing     frequent flier  minus the airplane    ok  this one isn’t quite so vexing    do this and you’ll manage your checking account successfully    debit  schmebit        
    you may have heard of cash for gold businesses — turn your gold into cash   the procedure for getting cash for your gold at these kinds of places goes like this        request an envelope     drop your gold jewelry in the envelope and mail it to them     they send you a check        easy peasy  right  it is  the catch is that some of these places really give you almost nothing compared to  what your gold jewelry is worth    of ten sites listed on one comparison site  the top one paid almost eight times the bottom one for the same gold necklace   the top site  expressgoldcash com  currently pays      for  kt gold  per pennyweight    this is the payout for the lowest quantity tier  which is zero to five ounces   if you send in more than that  they pay more per dwt      the real question is this  though   how does it compare to gold spot price   one pennyweight of  kt gold is about     troy ounces  so expressgoldcash is paying out just north of    per troy ounce   spot price is      per ounce  so they’re paying out more than half of spot for the gold     all in all  that’s pretty darn good  considering what they have to do to recoup their purchase   they have to handle the business costs of shipping the goods  paying you  and insuring your jewelry in transit   then they have to test your item to see that the purity is as advertised   then they have to melt the stuff and get it into a form that can be sold  usually a three nines bar      here’s another reason i know it’s a good price    they advertise what they pay prominently on their site    they know they pay out a lot for the gold  so it’s a selling point   as i went down the list on the comparison site i visited  the top three listed their current payouts    on the third one a little more digging was necessary to get the price  but it was there    the other sites did not advertise their prices   the sites that pay out less don’t want you to know how little they pay out until they have your items in hand     so the takeaway is if you’re going to use a cash for gold place on the web  then make sure at least that they advertise what they will pay you right on the site   you shouldn’t be finding out at the time you get your check         sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     value of a gold filled jewelry  a reader’s question    how much is that gold jewelry worth     so what about italian gold     melt value    do mail order gold places even know what they’re doing        
    our church has been doing a study on money in the adult sunday school classes through a video series from crown ministries     today’s lesson talked about racking up lots of credit card debt and expecting others to take care of you   oh wait … sorry … that was the pamphlet i saw for frown ministries   but seriously    today’s lesson discussed saving and investing  compound interest … all of that good stuff     one of the key ideas associated with compound interest is that it’s magic  i guess most people that talk about compound interest assume that the people listening think that math is boring  and that’s probably true  but the key ingredient to make the magic work is time  decades worth of time  usually     the lesson not only drove home that regular investment a good thing  but at the time it also seemed to suggest that wanting to do it any way but slowly and methodically was not a good thing  enter proverbs           a faithful man will be richly blessed  but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished   proverbs      niv       this statement concerned me a little because  a  i do often think about different ways to make money that are faster than compounding interest  and  b  i want to enjoy the fruits before they have to be put through a food processor and spoon fed to me  i’m reading through mj demarco’s   the millionaire fastlane   and he refers to this slow  systematic retirement plan as  well  the “slow lane ” does the desire to kick things into high gear make me “eager to get rich” as stated in proverbs          it’s a matter of balance and honesty     john gill  an english theologian in the late  th  early  th century  had this to say about the phrase       … but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent  he that is over anxious  and immoderately desirous of being rich  and pursues every method of obtaining his desires  with all his might and main  that labours night and day for it  though he takes no criminal nor unlawful methods  properly so called  nor does he do anything injurious to others  yet he is not innocent  that too much anxiety in him is criminal  nor is he free from covetousness  and if he uses any unjust and unlawful means to acquire wealth  and resolves to be rich  right or wrong … he shall not be innocent  neither before god nor men …     reference        there are many godly rich men mentioned in the bible  abraham  isaac  jacob  david  solomon  barnabus  and job  to name a few  so  it’s not ungodly to be rich  nor is it ungodly to become rich at a young age  if the person’s heart is in the right place  being hell bent on becoming rich  though  is the problem  and this is the notion that is connected with the word “eager ” it’s not the desire to be smart about making money to bring it in faster that’s bad  it’s both the manner in which it’s done  and also whether more important things are sacrificed in the process     so the takeaway for me is that wanting to get rich on an accelerated schedule isn’t necessarily “being eager to get rich ” but it can be  and i have to ask continually for wisdom as to whether i’m following the good path or one of the many bad ones    sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     top ten failed personal finance book titles    review of living the savvy life by melissa tosetti and kevin gibbons    link roundup  upstate ny edition    the mbn welcomes get rich slowly and no credit needed       million might not be enough to retire       
    luke “flexo” landes of  consumerism commentary  has a guest post over at wealth pilgrim on  whether the government should  have a ban on reward credit cards  the post had the flavor of a thought experiment  and i’m not aware of any talk to implement this     nonetheless  the thought of that idea sends a cold chill down my spine  not just because i like my perks — i do — but because the groups that might be calling for the change will be shooting themselves in the foot   getting the powers that be to “keep you from getting yourself into trouble” or to “protect you from that bully”   play big brother  or to keep that bully from picking on you is counterproductive  because the energy expended at complying with the powers that be are non productive   it’s a burden to everyone  and  it hurts just about everyone      the beauty of credit cards  if you have good credit  is that you can basically choose what terms you want and what perks you want  it’s a bit like ringtones  i have as my weapon of choice the i have the  chase sapphire®  card  every once in a while  i get enough points that i can cancel a charge from my bill  i like that  other people have airline cards  or starbucks cards  or whatever  why the heck not   whatever floats their float      if merchants push for this  they’ll get bitten too     supposedly the reward cards carry higher interchange fees than non reward cards  and this directly hits the merchants’ bottom line    so banning these cards will help the merchants  right   wrong   when the merchant account providers are restricted in what they can do to make money  they’re not just going to sit there   they’re going to make it up some other way   consider that merchant account providers  can no longer demand  that merchants accept all credit card transactions  regardless of amount   some merchants will set minimum charge amounts  and the issuers won’t see that interchange income   if we ignore the fact that the merchant is probably going to lose customers  then the issuers will bump up their prices  charge extra fees  etc   to make up the new shortfall     it’s the same thing with getting rid of reward cards   once the financial advantage of carrying a reward card goes away  then a number of things can happen   first  the additional income that the issuers got from the reward cards will be made up somehow   second  the people who were using the card will use them less now that the fun has been taken away   less money flying around means less money for the merchants   third  it’s one more measure of oversight that is a non productive drag on the economy   the short term gain in interchange fee expense will be handed back  and then some     if there’s a ban on reward credit cards  what about low interest cards   high risk  high rate  credit cards     what about credit cards in general    that’s the danger of banning any kind of credit card   it’s a step toward banning more    it’s the erosion of choice     sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     credit cards are not liquid evil    wading through gas credit card offers    uh huh  anti credit card legislation hurts just about everyone    a credit card for debt reduction    bargain hunting miles and points with credit cards       
    i met mike piper of  the oblivious investor  briefly at  fincon   and he came bearing gifts    i guess i was the oblivious conference attendee and did no such thing myself    i snagged two copies of his newest book    can i retire      i’ll offer the second copy to a randomly picked subscriber of my newsletter soon  so if you’re interested   sign up        can i retire   is part of his “  pages or less” series  and  well  the main text of the book ends squarely on page    so it’s truth in advertising   his motivation in putting this series together was to give essential information on a particular topic in a size that wouldn’t be so daunting to read   he fully admits that his book is just the beginning of answering the question in the title  so with that in mind  i read the book     i enjoyed it   the book was well written and free of financial jargon  but at the same time i didn’t feel like i was in third grade while reading it   it was a quick read  i got through it in maybe       hours  and part of the time i was riding up to a friend’s house   which  again  is the point of the book   it’s an approachable and doable introduction to the topic      standard topics with some essential details     the topics are nothing terribly mind blowing        calculating how much you’ll need to retire    the    withdrawal rate rule    single premium immediate annuities    index funds  exchange traded funds  bonds    iras and ira accounts    tax consequences of conversions  rollovers  and the like    social security       i picked up a number of things along the way   here are a couple of them         dollar cost averaging is a two edged sword    in a rising market  dollar cost averaging helps to automate the process of buying low  to sell high later    but in a falling  or fallen  market  withdrawing a fixed amount has the opposite effect  selling low      the overview of annuities is very good    i knew vaguely what annuities were but chapter   laid the basics out very well  especially the pros and cons of annuities  fixed return vs  variable return annuities  and diversifying annuities      having a tiered risk reward investment structure in retirement is a good idea    the idea and explanation of having short   mid   and long term investments in retirement was clearly presented    long term in retirement is more than five years out         all in all  this was a well organized introduction to answering the question of   can i retire    and i recommend it   the kindle edition is certainly worth    if you’re new to retirement planning    sign up for the  mighty bargain hunter newsletter       related posts     here’s the skinny on the skinny on    review of questions and answers on life insurance    review of bill schultheis’ the new coffeehouse investor    what is financial retirement     a retirement attitude adjustment

   i remain in  awe  of the amazing arrogance of politicians and news writers who simply cannot take  no  for answer no matter how many times it is spelled out  the horrendous  eurobond  idea simply will not go away  even though merkel and the german supreme court buried it long ago       even if merkel was willing to give in on the idea  finland and austria wouldn t  and more importantly neither would the german supreme court       yet people keep wasting time debating the merits of it  it s like debating the merits of perpetual motion  no matter what the merits might be  perpetual motion is not going to happen  so there is no point in debating it        run on the eurozone has started       eurointelligence proclaims  run on the eurozone has started     jose manuel barroso warned yesterday the euro would be “difficult or impossible” to sustain without further economic integration  german newspapers this morning produced a whole string of poisonous comments about the european commission’s proposals for eurobonds  the eurozone is now in a position where crisis resolution requires a much firmer political commitment than member states had expected to provide        german could accept eurobonds under certain conditions           taken at face value the german opposition against eurobonds seems to  be as strong as ever and most german papers such as süddeutsche zeitung  and handelsblatt report on the topic in these terms  nevertheless  the  resistance against the commission is less categorical than it appears   financial times deutschland   writes  angela merkel did not rule out eurobonds but rather said the  timing of josé manuel barroso’s proposal was “inappropriate”  among the  condition she enumerated were changes of the eu treaties and a much  stronger commitment of member states to condolidate  norbert barthle   the budgetary spokesperson of merkel’s cdu csu parliamentary group  told  ftd  “we never say never  all we say is  no eurobonds under current  conditions”  as a result there is scope for a deal at the eu summit  december    the idea is preposterous  there is no scope for a deal and no time for a deal even if there was scope  moreover  and even if there was scope and time  it would require a german referendum and treaty changes by all   eurozone countries       facts do not stop politicians or writers         hitler enters the equation        writer mark schieritz in  nazi adolf  inflation and the euro crisis  blames the rise of hitler on the gold standard and deflation      the  hyperinflation of the twenties led to so that the weimar republic was  entirely prescribed a hard currency strategy   regardless of losses   others were wiser because        after  leaving the gold standard  the uk saw its unemployment rate decline by  about a third from   to    while germany s rose over the same  period significantly    if  germany had been willing to follow the uk in inflating  and its  unemployment rate had followed a similar trajectory  it would have stood  at    rather than           in other words  perhaps the greatest catastrophe in human history could  have been prevented if the germans had allowed a little more inflation       the euro in its present form is in many ways comparable to the gold standard   the cause of the great depression was the runup in credit that preceded it  blaming gold for the rise of hitler or for the great depression is preposterous  begging for inflation is equally preposterous       economies go through these massive boom bust cycles because of inflation  fractional reserve lending  and rampant credit expansion  the cure cannot be the same as the disease no matter how one tries to distort the facts with untenable correlations       central banks  governments  fiat currencies  and fractional reserve lending are responsible for every major economic bust in history and fools come back begging for more        enough  eurobonds are not going to happen  nor should they happen        for a detailed discussion of why eurobonds and ecb printing are piss poor ideas   please see  understanding the problem  understanding the solution  and understanding who is to blame are three different things        i wrote that last evening but failed to post it  at the time us futures were up over     now i see they were flat  the reason  i presume this        merkel reiterates the obvious       bloomberg reports  european stocks  euro fall on merkel comments     the euro weakened  italian bonds declined and the cost of insuring european government against default rose to a record after german chancellor angela merkel ruled out joint euro area borrowing  european stocks fluctuated        euro bonds are “not needed and not appropriate ” merkel said at a press conference with italian prime minister mario monti and french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg  france       “the market sees a ‘no’ and reacts to it ” said martin huefner  chief economist at assenagon gmbh in munich  which manages more than      billion of client assets  “we’re going to see a deterioration of equity markets in the coming months to the point where something will have to be done  the market would be euphoric to get euro bonds  apparently the pressure is not big enough yet ”   no hope or future for eurobonds       huefner has it backwards  the market hears  yes  and reacts to it  even when it is damn obvious the answer is no       there is no hope or future for eurobonds and there never was        no matter how many times this is explained or reiterated  some eurocratic fool or some fool writer finds some lame excuse to attempt to revive the dead  the latest  yesterday  was preposterous analysis by the financial times suggesting merkel did not  really  mean no  this was followed up with the ludicrous idea by mark schieritz who blamed gold and  lack of inflation  for the rise of hitler       sheeesh        now that eurobonds are finally dead  hopefully   can we please start a rational discussion as to how best to break up the eurozone        mike   mish   shedlock   http   globaleconomicanalysis blogspot com       click here to scroll thru

   ambrose evans pritchard is back on track with  ireland demands debt relief  warns on eu treaties  the irish government has suddenly complicated the picture by requesting debt relief from as a reward for upholding the integrity of the eu financial system after the lehman crisis  though there is no explicit linkage between the two issues        we carried an undue burden for protecting the european banking system from contagion   said finance minister michael noonan        we are looking at ways to reduce the debt  we would like to see our european colleagues address this in a positive manner  wherever there is a reckless borrower  there is also a reckless lender   he said  alluding to german  french  british and dutch banks       mr noonan hinted that dublin is asking for some of interested relief on a € bn eu promissory noted linked to the anglo irish fiasco  among other matters       mr noonan said ireland s public mood has turned very sour         we have indicated to europe s authorities that it will be difficult to get the irish public to pass a referendum on treaty change   he said        mr noonan said the country will stay the course with unbending austerity  even though nominal gross national product  gnp  has already contracted by  pc  public wages have fallen  pc on average under ireland s  internal devaluation  policy to regain competitiveness within emu  there are likely to be further wage cuts in the december budget        we have to face reality  there is no painless way  no soft option  we re going to cut spending drastically  but with social cohesion  we don t want situation we see in greece with people on streets and the foundations of state under threat  we re not going that route     will  not may       pritchard summed up the entire situation quite nicely in his opening lead   europe s plans for treaty changes to enforce fiscal discipline in the eurozone  may  fall foul of popular anger in ireland unless the eu creditor states agree to share more of the pain         my one quibble is with the word  may   the correct word is will       i am quite disappointed that it took ireland this long  voters smashed the fianna fail  ff  party to smithereens in february  see  massive rout in irish elections  collision course with the eu  default the best option for ireland    to teary eyed outgoing politicians  only to see incoming party fine gael  led by incoming prime minister enda kenny  do the exact same thing ff would have done  bail out german and french banks at the expense of irish taxpayers       quite frankly this is maddening  what the hell good are elections if the only choice by either party is to bail out the banks  worse yet  in ireland s situation  it is foreign banks that are bailed out        enda kenny  pleads  for help        actually  kenny did not  demand  debt relief  he begged for it  moreover he is willing to kiss ass to get it       the wall street journal reports  irish pm kenny  must meet targets to win back economic sovereignty     ireland will have to meet the austerity budget targets set by its bailout lenders if the country is to get its economic sovereignty back  irish prime minister enda kenny said tuesday       he told the irish parliament that looming budget measures will be as fair as possible to balance the requirements of its european union and international monetary fund lenders while protecting the most vulnerable in irish society        clearly  if we are to have our economic sovereignty back we can t go on as we were   kenny said   if kenny had any backbone at all he would have told the imf and eu to  go to hell  just as icelandic voters did and more importantly  just as irish voters expected  instead  kenny wimped out to the exact same demands from the imf and eu that fianna fail would have done        public mood turns sour        mr noonan  ireland s finance minister said  ireland s public mood has turned very sour        of course it has  wimps like kenny and noonan have caved into every eu and imf demand  at the expense of irish taxpayers  in spite of an overwhelming election to do something different       i repeat what i said earlier today in  eventually  will come a time when             eventually  there will come a time when a populist office seeker will  stand before the voters  hold up a copy of the eu treaty and  correctly   declare all the  bail out  debt foisted on their country to be null and  void  that person will be elected        kenny did not do what he was elected to do  he should be kicked out of office on his ass and replaced by someone who will       mike   mish   shedlock   http   globaleconomicanalysis blogspot com       click here to scroll thru my recent           post list   mike  mish

   inquiring minds note that french presidential candidate  le pen calls for france to quit euro     marine le pen  the leader of france’s far right national front  has made abandoning the euro one of the pillars of her presidential election campaign  launching a powerful attack on the ailing single currency as she seeks to bolster her already strong showing in the opinion polls       presenting her “presidential project”  ms le pen said europe should give up the euro  which had “asphyxiated our economies  killed our industries and choked our jobs” for years  as well as causing france to accumulate “himalayan” debts  in any case  she added  the country should prepare a planned exit from the currency union  “we need to anticipate the collapse of the euro rather than suffer from the collapse of the euro ” she said in a television interview on sunday  le pen supports misguided policies on trade and numerous other issues  however  protectionists and isolationists will eventually win the way  on one issue and one issue alone       last april  in finland  the  true finn  party soared from obscurity based on one simple idea   stopping bailouts of euro zone member states   the rest of the  true finn  platform was cancerous  yet meaningless  voters everywhere are fed up with bailouts        my point       eventually  there will come a time when a populist office seeker will stand before the voters  hold up a copy of the eu treaty and  correctly  declare all the  bail out  debt foisted on their country to be null and void  that person will be elected       le pen may be too early  and france may not be that country  but the time will come       greece  finland  germany  belgium  and even france are possibilities  all it will take  is for one charismatic person  timing social mood correctly  to say precisely one right thing at exactly the right time  it will happen       mike   mish   shedlock   http   globaleconomicanalysis blogspot com       click here to scroll thru my recent           post list   mike  mish  shedlock is a registered investment advisor representative for sitkapacific capital management  sitka pacific is an asset management firm whose goal is strong performance and low volatility  regardless of market direction   visit http   www sitkapacific com account management html to learn more about wealth management and capital preservation strategies of sitka pacific

   ambrose evans pritchard speaks of the  self serving myths of europe’s neo calvinists        in his article he chastises germany for its role in the eurozone mess  citing germany’s wolfgang schauble and the northern neo calvinists  pritchard also praises a report by simon tilford and philip whyte on how  stricter rules threaten the eurozone        there is certainly much in the report that i agree with  primarily a description of the problem  unfortunately  there is even more i disagree with  notably the solution       ideas i agree with         creditor countries cannot be absolved of all blame     if the eurozone had been a fully fledged fiscal union  it would not be in its  current  predicament   mish  it would be a  different  predicament  likely much worse     the current crisis is not simply a tale of fiscal irresponsibility and lost competitiveness in the eurozone’s geographical periphery  it is also about the unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances to which the launch of the euro contributed  in creditor and debtor countries     the challenges presented by greece were always going to be daunting  given the dysfunctional nature of its political economy     the medicine prescribed to greece – which was partly motivated by an urge to punish it and to take a stand against moral hazard – was doomed to failure     a year’s worth of punishing austerity and contracting activity has only succeeded in pushing greece deeper into insolvency     the eurozone will not emerge from the debt crisis without economic growth     it is now clear that a currency shared by fiscally sovereign member states is more vulnerable to losses of confidence than a monetary union that is more fully integrated     a familiar pattern has now set in  under market duress  leaders hold an emergency summit and announce an agreement designed to restore confidence once and for all     after an initial bout of euphoria  financial markets digest the contents of the agreement  conclude that it does not resolve the underlying problems  and the cycle starts all over again  each agreement buys less time and the stakes become larger with every summit        hopefully we can all agree on those   points  the problem is the euro was fatally flawed from the beginning        no in many languages       no currency union has ever survived without there being a fiscal union at the same time  is germany to blame for this       i say nein  non  ochi  iie  nie  nej  and of course no        who is to blame        the rules of the maastricht treaty were known by everyone at the outset and there were many architects of the euro idea including jean claude trichet  in that regard it makes as much sense to blame france as it does germany        moreover  countries could have accepted or rejected the treaty  every country had a vote  or many votes   as politicians crammed the euro down their citizens  throats whether they wanted it or not        the uk chose wisely  other countries did not  including germany  every country stupid enough to enter this untenable arrangement can look in the mirror and blame themselves        the non solutions       unfortunately  the rest of the report borders on the nonsensical  notably   all eurozone countries should therefore finance debt by issuing bonds which would be jointly guaranteed by all of them         the authors then proceed to discuss all the inherent problems with the idea including   moral hazards    borrowing targets  etc  stating   a dogmatic target of budgetary balance four years hence  irrespective of a country’s position in the economic cycle  would achieve little          the authors then have to figure out a way around dogmatic targets  proposing   rules should be set with reference to the cyclically adjusted fiscal position for each member state         that of course creates another problem as to how to do that  coming to the conclusion that   votes is too many  and a creditor dominated board would not work  but   a board of nine economists  from the big eurozone economies  the european commission  the european central bank  ecb  and the oecd  might  form a good basis         good grief          wait  i am not done yet  the authors freely admit   the issuance of eurobonds will not prevent debt crises in the absence of steps to reduce trade imbalances within the eurozone    then attempt to dream up solutions to that problem       that idea makes as much sense as attempting to solve a trade disparity between california and indiana          we are still not done yet  the authors see a need to   set up a jointly funded  eurozone wide deposit protection scheme         finally  the authors conclude   the ecb’s mandate is too restrictive  the central bank must guard against excessive inflation  but its fear of inflation blinds it to the much more serious threats confronting the eurozone economy         apparently europe needs a  mandate  but one that is meaningless  and allows the central bank to print at will        conclusion          the authors ramble on about various problems  real and imagined  then conclude with        eurozone leaders now face a choice between two unpalatable alternatives  either they accept that the eurozone is institutionally flawed and do what is necessary to turn it into a more stable arrangement  this will require some of them to go beyond what their voters seem prepared to allow  and to accept that a certain amount of ‘rule breaking’ is necessary in the short term if the eurozone is to survive intact  or they can stick to the fiction that confidence can be restored by the adoption  and enforcement  of tougher rules  this option will condemn the eurozone to self defeating policies that hasten defaults  contagion and eventual break up   indeed  not       pritchard  cited the above paragraph and finished with  indeed  read it all       i did read it all and nearly threw up at the self serving myth there are only two options         break the rules    stick to self defeating policies        there is a third option and pritchard should know it well  plan for a breakup of the eurozone and make banks write down bad investments  bondholders will take a hit  but they deserve to  it is time to stop bailing out banks at the expense of taxpayers       the report by simon tilford and philip whyte with all their convoluted solutions culminating in the creation of a  fiscal nanny zone  should be enough to convince anyone the euro is not worth saving       countries that disagree can keep the damn thing  if france wants a fiscal nanny state and unlimited printing by the ecb  fine  let france have it        true solution        the best solution and the one i propose is for germany to leave the eurozone  i am quite sure other countries in northern europe would follow  the euro will still survive in my proposal  and france can be king of the nanny hill if it elects to stay in       yes this would be disruptive  however  it would give the euro fools what they want and northern european voters  not politicians  what they want       michael pettis outlined a compelling case why germany exiting the eurozone is the best option  please see  eurozone breakup logistics  never believe anything until it s officially denied   for details        the euroskeptics were right        the euroskeptics were right  straight from the beginning  pritchard was among those skeptics  he was right then  he was also correct in a major way when he stated the german supreme court would not allow eurobonds or ecb printing       please see  germany s    top judge throws major monkey wrench into leveraged efsf machinery     demands new constitution and popular referendum for further powers  for details       unfortunately he is wrong now  in more ways than one         pritchard is wrong on who to blame    pritchard is wrong to perpetrate the myth the euro can be saved     pritchard is wrong about fearing deflation  a natural state of affairs actually  it is only fractional reserve lending and mountains of debt that bring upon such fears  the solution is to get rid of central bankers and end fractional reserve lending     pritchard is wrong to not fear inflation in the scenario proposed by tilford and whyte          eurobond  unlimited printing foolishness       i am not the only one who thinks the eurobond  unlimited printing idea is beyond foolish  john hussman had an excellent writeup on monday  why the ecb won t  and shouldn t  just print     over the past week  we ve heard all sorts of propositions that the european central bank  ecb   must  begin printing money to bail out italy and other countries  because  there is no other option   there are three basic difficulties with this idea       the first is that ecb buying might help to address immediate liquidity issues of distressed european countries  but it would not address long term solvency issues  and would in fact make them worse       the second is that the ecb  under existing european treaties  has no such authority  and the prohibitions against it are very explicit  changing that would be far more difficult than many market participants seem to believe  because it would require an explicit and unanimous change in the eu treaties that aaa rated countries such as germany and finland vehemently oppose        the third difficulty is that even if the ecb was to buy the debt of distressed european countries with printed money  the inflationary effects would likely be far more swift than anything we ve seen in the united states  this would not  save  the euro  but would simply destroy it by other means    hussman builds an excellent case       i will conclude the way pritchard did

   european officials have had enough of the technocrat leadership in greece  they have given a week for antonis samaras  the leader of new democracy party  and member of the coalition to sign a document saying he will support the european union debt plan       he says he will support the plan  with modifications   the eu wants a signature now  with no changes        does a signature even matter         other than pigheadedness on behalf of the eu  does a signature even matter  why  the next government can easily vote to undo whatever this government does  will samaras remain in power  is his signature binding on the next parliament  or even this one        i will have more questions in a moment but first consider a couple of articles        eu gives deadline on signatures       ekathimerini reports  eu sets deadline for signatures     european officials insisted on tuesday that party leaders in greece’s coalition government must provide written guarantees expressing their commitment to a new european union debt plan before a eurogroup summit next tuesday to unlock crucial rescue funding  but center right new democracy appeared unmoved and the right wing popular orthodox rally  laos     the third party in the coalition    appeared to harden its stance against the country’s creditors       sources in brussels told kathimerini that the eu decided to send athens the ultimatum after talks between european commission president jose manuel barroso and new democracy’s vice president stavros dimas  who is also foreign minister  failed to secure a shift in the stance of nd president antonis samaras  who has refused to offer written guarantees to brussels  saying his word should be enough       eurogroup chief jean claude juncker  who received greek prime minister lucas papademos in strasbourg  said he hoped party leaders would fulfill eu demands by tuesday  “would there be no cross party agreement  that disbursement of course could not take place ” juncker said  referring to an   billion euro loan without which greece faces default next month       there was pressure from elsewhere too  dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said his country would bar further aid unless samaras changes his tune  “we want to see a signature from mr samaras… otherwise  as far as i am concerned  they will get no money  absolutely not ” but nd spokesman yiannis michelakis indicated that nd’s leader was unmoved  “i have nothing to add on the issue of the signature that is being asked of samaras ” he said       meanwhile the leader of laos  giorgos karatzaferis  shifted from his earlier suggestion that he would do “everything necessary” to secure crucial loans  saying that instead of signing a letter  he would write an article outlining his commitments in his party’s newspaper   samaras won t sign  sends letter instead       athens news reports  samaras won t sign  epp letter published     as the pressure mounts on the major greek party leaders to provide written support for the october     eurozone deal  new democracy  nd  president antonis samaras has reiterated his stance that he will not sign such a statement       nd party spokesman yiannis mihelakis stressed on tuesday that he has nothing further to add on the issue of  samaras  signature over commitments requested by the ec ecb imf  troika   mihelakis added that samaras has made specific statements saying he backs the october   eu summit agreement  adding that no request has been made on behalf of the european union as regards the nd leader’s signature        in the letter  samaras underlines the fact that he supports prime minister lucas papademos and the targets of fiscal adjustment but notes that “certain policies have to be modified”   policy changes        who blinks first  samaras or the eu       while pondering that question  consider this logic from my friend bran who every day sends me links like those above       bran writes        imagine a us bill launched by the democrats affecting international shipping  suppose the bill gets a mixed vote and passes        along come the chinese who are part beneficiaries of the bill and they then insist not just the president sign it  but also demand the head of the republican party to do so  or they will not abide by their reciprocally enacted legislation   just imagine that setup and tell me how speaker of the house john boehner or senate minority leader mitch mcconnell might react       even if the congressional leaders did sign such a document  would it be binding on the next congress       in the case of greece  elections will be held early next year  supposedly   with all these demands and all this political posturing  one has to wonder       i for one hope samaras holds firm and does not sign  the quicker the eurozone blows up  the better it will be for everyone        mike   mish   shedlock   http   globaleconomicanalysis blogspot com       click here to scroll thru my

to a halt  a move which threatened to derail the country’s near   month search for a new administration       elio di rupo  leader of the french speaking socialists  had attempted to form a government based on a six party coalition of dutch and french speaking socialists  liberals and christian democrats but there was little common ground on how to make the budget cuts mandated by the european

handed in his resignation to the country’s monarch  king albert ii         di rupo handed in his resignation once before  in july  when talks over the electoral boundaries collapsed  at that stage the

its cost of borrowing increasing steadily  spreads between belgian   year bonds and benchmark german bunds rose sharply in november  going above   basis points  up from   basis points at the start of

the government might have to bail out its banks because of losses in central and eastern europe  where they are the biggest lenders  and their exposure to italy        the moves by austria  which appear to be unilateral  show how even the eurozone’s strongest economies are feeling the pressure of the sovereign debt crisis       the austrian central bank said in a statement that erste group

the team at currency online  capital flight and forced repatriation in europe          bruce krasting had an excellent article over the weekend on zerohedge regarding  capital flight and forced repatriation  put yourself in the mind of a greek who had some savings in a local bank  what would you do  you would do whatever you could to get your money to high ground  it would be perfectly reasonable for you to do that  and that is exactly what the greeks have done  they’ve moved billions of euros to swiss banks in an effort to preserve their wealth  in the process they have crippled the greek banks and have added to the downward spiral in greece and the rest of the eu       there was  imho  a very significant development on this front last week  a move is being made in brussels to “force” the swiss government banks to transfer all of the assets of greek citizens back to the greek banks  for a greek this means that your money is hostage  it has been functionally expropriated  it will be transferred into a banking system that is fraught with risk  some portion of the money that goes back to greece will certainly be lost       i have talked with some who i know in athens  they are out of their minds with this development         brussels — the european commission is helping greece negotiate an agreement with switzerland to repatriate as much as    billion believed to be hidden in swiss bank accounts  a high level european union executive body official said nov                 billion  that’s massive  this is not the shopkeeper or pensioner  this is big bucks and that means the greek shippers  it is a fact that the greek government doesn’t tax the foreign earnings of the shippers  call that a mistake  but that is the law  as a result  the shippers have held huge bucks in switzerland  it’s not dirty money  right or wrong  there was no legal tax on this        the european commission is working with switzerland and greece stop what it believes is an ongoing exodus of money from greek bank accounts into swiss and other offshore banking centers  the eu official said        the only way to stop capital flight is to address the underlying causes of the flight  that can’t happen in greece for years  the alternative is to trap the money  force it to go where it is at most risk  the owner of the money will have no choice  any rights they might have to preserve their assets will be abrogated       i’m amazed at this development  the swiss government banks are obligated to cooperate with eu tax authorities when there is evidence of tax fraud  but that is not what this is about  the people in brussels and bern know that  the fact is that the greek tax system is so screwed up that there simply are no taxes levied on certain types of income capital  the shippers   no doubt  some of the greek cash that is in switzerland is there because of tax avoidance  but the vast majority is simply safe haven money       the word “repatriation” sounds nice enough but really it means “theft and expropriation”  there will be nothing voluntary about this  there will be little  if any  due process  if you have money in greek banks  get it out now  if it s a small amount put it under the mattress  if it s a large amount  i am not sure where to tell you to put given pressure on switzerland and illegal requests from the eu       mike  mish  shedlock

   tonight i received a thoughtful email from reader rick cameron who made some observations and notes way back in   and recently went back to review those notes       his notes are regarding the  european erm   the exchange rate mechanism  that was supposed to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in europe        before i list the thoughts of cameron  here is some background information on the erm and the countries involves       the uk entered the erm in   but in   britain exited the erm after the pound sterling came under pressure from george soros  dubbing soros as  the man who broke the bank of england        in   the currency band had to be expanded    to accommodate speculation against the french franc and other currencies       wikepedia notes the erm came to be known as an  eternal recession mechanism  after britain fell into recession during the early  s        european erm   replay        with that backdrop  please consider this email from cameron     hello mish      i am a student of history  and i was an active investor in    i have recently gone back and looked at my notes and the charts and the media comments about the uk and the european exchange rate mechanism        the parallels between the uk in   and germany in   are striking       under the erm  the  financially  stronger countries would be responsible for the weaker ones  then the berlin wall fell  the eastern european countries tanked  and the uk was on the hook to support them       there was lots of pressure on john majors not to continue that policy and to leave the erm  political dithering followed  complete with bold speeches by both brits and the europeans about unity  the brits held their ground in the face of enormous pressure on the pound  culminating with a   b currency buyback in mid september        students of history know what happened next  the brits finally threw in the towel  left the erm  and the pound tanked from      to     from september  th to september  th  then to      by november  george soros made    billion       every article i read today about the ecb  the germans  and the euro  resembles closely some similar article i have about the bank of england  the british government  the erm  and the eventual fall of the pound       to me  it seems like an inevitable march down the same road   same players  same dithering  same posturing  same lack of attention to any of the real problems  same case of refusing to deal with any of the real issues   and sadly  the issues in   were exactly the same as they are today       are the financially strong northern european countries going to support the weaker eastern and southern european countries  everyone in europe loves the idea   until they have to write checks with their own money  then it all come unglued  every time       finally  we need to not forget that the guy who stubbornly held onto the concept of the brits supporting the erm  no matter the cost and pain to the british taxpayers was none other than john majors  who at the time was working on the maastricht treaty        to quote peter  paul  and mary  when will they ever learn        have a good day      rick cameron  same issues  same players       yes indeed  we have exactly the same issues and same players  note that the uk is still on the outside looking in  with the rest of europe clamoring to get the uk in        the smart play would be for cameron to stay on the outside  looking  out  as noted in  will cameron sell uk down the river for worthless promises  two speed europe and the clutches of france        since    there has been an obvious change in political leadership  however  the politicians involved all still seek the same proverbial free lunch        irony of the  maastricht treaty       the irony of the maastricht treaty is that it did temporarily bring about the currency stability everyone wanted  however   that currency stability came at the expense of something far worse   inherent interest rate  instability   coupled with heightened fiscal  instability         it just took some time to play out       now  instead of attempting to defend untenable currency targets  the ecb  the eurocrats  and the imf all have their hands full attempting to maintain untenable interest rate targets  with yields soaring in greece  spain  italy  ireland  portugal  and belgium in relation to germany  the troika has failed       to alleviate interest rate concerns and fiscal instability caused by the maastricht treaty  politicians now openly discuss breaking up the eurozone  which of course will immediately kick off a full blown currency crisis in various countries        interest rates on government bonds go full circle                 click on chart for sharper image       chart from  spiegel online       when the currency crisis happens and the eurozone breaks up as is inevitable  europe will have gone full circle on both interest rates

   the uk had been expected to have a voter referendum on proposed eu treaty changes  the eu of course does not want voter referendums or anything that look remotely democratic as we have seen by actions in greece and italy         deal or no deal        the problem for the eu is all   nations have to agree to treaty changes or it s no deal  a political work around is in progress  as always    and merkel will allegedly give up on the financial transaction tax idea if only cameron will sign on the bottom line        piss poor deal       it s a piss poor deal and cameron should know it  once the eu gets what they want  sarkozy and merkel and others will be back at it  demanding once again the financial transaction tax and god only knows what else        secret plans to derail referendum       the telegraph notes  germany s secret plans to derail a british referendum on the eu     germany has drawn up secret plans to prevent a british referendum on the overhaul of the european union amid concerns it could derail the eurozone rescue package  leaked documents obtained by the daily telegraph disclose        angela merkel  the german chancellor  is today expected to tell david cameron that britain does not need a referendum on eu treaty changes  despite demands from senior conservatives for more powers to be repatriated to britain       the leaked memo  written by the german foreign office  discloses radical plans for an intrusive new european body that will be able to take over the economies of beleaguered eurozone countries       it discloses that the eu’s largest economy is also preparing for other european countries  which are too large to be bailed out  to default on their debts — effectively going bankrupt  it will prompt fears that german plans to deal with the eurozone crisis involve an erosion of national sovereignty that could pave the way for a european “super state” with its own tax and spending plans set in brussels       britain would be relegated to a new outer group of eu members who are not in the single currency  mr cameron will today travel to brussels and berlin for tense negotiations with mrs merkel amid growing disagreement between the leaders over how to deal with the eurozone        the six page german foreign ministry paper sets out plans for the creation of a european monetary fund with a transfer of sovereignty away from member states       the fund will have the power to take ailing countries into receivership and run their economies  even more controversially  the document  entitled the future of the eu  required integration policy improvements for the creation of a stability union  declares that the treaty changes are a first stage “in which the eu will develop into a political union”  “the debate on the way towards a political union must begin as soon as the course toward stability union is charted ” it concludes       the negotiating document also explicitly examines ways to limit treaty changes to speed up the reforms  it indicates that mrs merkel will tell mr cameron to rule out a popular eu vote in britain       “limiting the effect of the treaty changes to the eurozone states would make ratification easier  which would nevertheless be required by all eu member states  thereby less referenda could be necessary  which could also affect the uk  ” read the paper        open europe  a think tank  last night called for mr cameron to demand something in return from mrs merkel for her “far reaching plan”  which requires the unanimous consent of all   eu countries  giving britain a veto       “it would be the first step towards a vision of  political union’ that would have major consequences for the future of the entire eu  and therefore the uk’s place within it ” said stephen booth  the think tank s research director        merkel is daring cameron to call her bluff  but if the uk is serious about taking a leadership role in shaping the eu  cameron will have to take a stand sooner rather than later        bill cash  chairman of the commons european scrutiny committee  accused the coalition of standing by in  no–man s land  while germany shaped the eu to suit its own interests        we are going to get nothing significant in return for agreeing to this   he said       mr cameron is today also expected to pressurise mrs merkel into lifting german opposition to the use of the european central bank to rescue the euro    two speed europe and the clutches of france       the guardian reports  cameron warned his eurozone stance risks forcing two speed europe        david cameron will be warned that he risks creating an unstoppable momentum behind a  two speed europe   which would be dominated by france and germany  if britain demands too many concessions during the eurozone crisis       in a series of meetings in berlin and brussels  the prime minister will be advised that britain should table modest proposals next year when eu leaders embark on a small treaty revision to underpin the euro       a six page german foreign ministry paper  published by der spiegel this week  calls for  a   small   convention that is precisely limited in terms of content  to present proposals  rapidly   these would then be agreed by all   members of the eu       merkel warned the prime minister at an emergency european council meeting in brussels on   october that she would reluctantly have to side with france if britain overplayed its hand in the negotiations  nicolas sarkozy  the french president  wants a treaty to be agreed among the   members of the eurozone  excluding britain and the other nine eu members outside the single currency       this would be seen as a major step towards the formalisation of a  two speed europe  in which france  germany and the four other triple a rated eurozone members would form an inner core  britain and denmark  the only two members of the eu with a legal opt out from the euro  would form the backbone of an outer core       one brussels diplomat said   there is a choice the uk has to make  does it push germany into the clutches of france or does it try to find an accommodation with the germans by not going too far in its demands on repatriating powers  the germans want to find an accommodation with the british but they must not go too far   got that  cameron is supposed to accept a bad deal from merkel  or germany will make an even worse deal with france        german finance minister says uk will join the euro       talk like this should scare the hell out of the uk citizens   britain will have to join the euro  says tory grandee lord heseltine     britain will soon have no choice but to join the euro  tory grandee lord heseltine has claimed  as tensions grow over the eurozone s slow moving efforts to get a grip on the spreading debt crisis        the former deputy prime minister  a long time supporter of the single currency  said the public had  no idea  about the potential impact its collapse would have on the uk       but he believes franco german determination will secure the euro s future and pave the way for britain to sign up       both the coalition and the labour party have ruled out adopting the euro in the foreseeable future       last month prime minister david cameron suffered the biggest ever conservative revolt over europe as more than   conservative mps defied his orders and backed a referendum on britain’s membership of the european union       german finance minister says uk will join euro       please consider  britain  will join euro before long’  says german finance minister     wolfgang schäuble said that  despite the current crisis in the eurozone  the euro will ultimately emerge as the common currency of the entire european union  he said he “respects” britain’s decision to keep the pound  but insisted that the survival and eventual stabilisation of the euro will convince non members to join the currency club  “this may happen more quickly than some people in the british isles currently believe ” he added       mr schäuble also said germany will stand firm on its call for a financial transaction tax that britain believes would badly harm the city of london        sir john major  the former prime minister  warned last night that the growing integration of the eurozone nations threatens democracy in those countries  he told al jazeera television that richer euro members led by germany and france will “insist on moving towards what we call fiscal union  by that i mean common control over budgets and fiscal deficits”        sir john  who advises david cameron on foreign policy issues  also described the banking transaction tax as “a heat seeking missile proposed in continental europe  aimed at the city of london”    promises on transaction tax will not be kept       the arrogant talk by schäuble in and of itself should be enough to convince cameron that the financial transaction tax talk will never go away and that no deal with merkel can be trusted       thus  cameron should not agree to any treaty changes except those for the explicit purpose of creating exit procedure for countries to leave the euro        the eurozone is about to break up yet merkel  schäuble  sarkozy and others still cling to failed ideas  pressure on the uk is nothing but last minute sheer desperation by those attempting to bully the uk into accepting the creation of a nanny zone super state       the irony is both cameron and merkel want something that is blatantly stupid  cameron wants the ecb to buy bonds on a massive scale  while merkel wants the financial transaction tax and a nanny zone super state  all three ideas are horrendous       should cameron get sucked into a lousy deal  which means virtually any deal merkel will offer   all cameron would accomplish would be to prolong the agony       enough is enough  cameron should tell merkel  no deal   which of course is the polite way of saying  go to hell

    regular readers of tbp know that i spend some time rooting around in the excellent  american presidency project   a remarkable resource   sometimes i’m looking for something specific  other times i’m just getting a feel  a flavor  for the message coming from our leadership  specifically the president   the latter was the case when i undertook a search to see how the phrase “home ownership” has been used by presidents over time     herewith  fdr’s message to congress  april        spooky stuff      to the congress     as further and  urgently necessary step in the program to promote economic recovery  i  ask the congress for legislation to protect small home owners from  foreclosure and to relieve them of a portion of the burden of excessive  interest and principal payments incurred during the period of higher  values and higher earning power     implicit in the legislation which  i am suggesting to you is a declaration of national policy  this policy  is that the broad interests of the nation require that special  safeguards should be thrown around home ownership as a guarantee of social and economic stability  and that to protect  home owners from inequitable enforced liquidation in a time of general  distress is a proper concern of the government     the legislation i  propose follows the general lines of the farm mortgage refinancing bill   the terms are such as to impose the least possible charge upon the  national treasury consistent with the objects sought  it provides  machinery through which existing mortgage debts on small homes may be  adjusted to a sound basis of values without injustice to investors  at  substantially lower interest rates and with provision for postponing  both interest and principal payments in cases of extreme need  the  resources to be made available through a bond issue to be guaranteed as  to interest only by the treasury  will  it is thought  be sufficient to  meet the needs of those to whom other methods of financing are not  available  at the same time the plan of settlement will provide a  standard which should put an end to present uncertain and chaotic  conditions that create fear and despair among both home owners and  investors     legislation of this character is a subject that demands our most earnest  thoughtful and prompt consideration       source      franklin d  roosevelt  message to congress on small home mortgage foreclosures       – message to congress on small home mortgage foreclosures    american presidency project  april         http   www presidency ucsb edu ws index php pid       adding   did not know when br was going to run this piece  but since he slated it for thanksgiving  i’ll take this opportunity to wish everyone a happy  healthy and safe holiday   enjoy friends and family                                                                                   
    i have repeatedly demonstrated that – despite the false  divide and conquer tactics of the mainstream parties and mainstream  media –  the overwhelming majority of americans agree on the most important issues facing our country   see  this      no more bailouts     as i’ve noted since      americans are united in their overwhelming disapproval for bailouts to the big banks     this has remained true right up to today     as rassmussen found only last month  as summarized by  kxlf news        today’srasmussen reports survey finds that most americans don’t like bailouts for financial institutions        oppose financial bailouts     say wall street benefited most    survey of     american adults           • just    think it was a good idea  for the government to provide bailout funding to banks and other  financial institutions  but    say otherwise     • while many activists try to link the republican party and wall street  republicans think the bailouts were a bad idea by an eight to one margin     • those not affiliated with either major party think they were a bad  idea by a four to one margin  democrats are much more evenly divided   thirty four percent      of those in the president’s party say the  bailouts were a good idea while    disagree     • overall     believe that most of the bailout money went to the very people who created the nation’s ongoing economic crisis  but    disagree and    aren’t sure      as the washington post’s greg sargent  notes    the recent proposal from lobbyists to the american bankers association  recommending ways to co opt the occupy movement accurately stated      well known wall street companies stand at the nexus of  where ows protestors and the tea party overlap on angered populism  both  the radical left and the radical right are channeling broader  frustration about the state of the economy and share a mutual anger over  tarp and other perceived bailouts  this combination has the potential  to be explosive later in the year when media reports cover the next  round of bonuses and contrast it with stories of millions of americans  making do with less this holiday season       except that it is the majority of americans – not “extremists” on either side of the aisle – that share this anger      the “tea party” movement was centered on the protesting government bailouts of the giant banks  before it was hijacked by the mainstream republican party  sarah palin  neocons and others  see  this    this    this    this  and  this      ron paul  said  last month at a gop debate      bailouts came from both parties…  if you have to give  money out  you should give it to people losing their mortgages  not to  the banks      and one of the most common sayings of occupy wall street protesters is      banks got bailed out  we got sold out      see  this  and  this       end crony capitalism     i  noted  last year      a  rassmussen poll  conducted in february found          of all voters  believe that the government and big  business typically work together in ways that hurt consumers and  investors       and see  this       remember that the  government helped and encouraged the giant banks  to get even bigger  and then has  hidden their insolvency and s  hielded them from the free market    and helped them grow even during the severe downturn     in return  the big banks and giant corporations have  literally bought and paid  for the politicians     conservatives might call it “socialism” and liberals might call it “fascism” –  they are the same thing economically      but all americans – conservatives and liberals alike – can agree that it is not capitalism  and it is not american      prosecute wall street fraud     i  pointed out  a year ago      liberals tend to believe that the public should be  protected against harm  while conservatives tend to believe that people  should be left free to buy what they want     too far apart to ever agree     no  conservatives believe that people must be held responsible for  their actions and punished for their transgressions  indeed  some      of the american public wants tougher regulation of wall street     moreover  even for those who don’t like the government sticking its nose in our business  liberals and conservatives agree that if a  company chooses to make a representation about something  it can be  sued if it is a lie  in other words  all americans agree that fraud laws  should be enforced against everyone from  the homeowner who fills out a mortgage application on a small house to  the head of a giant bank who makes false statements about the bank’s  balance sheets and the quality of it’s investments     everyone agrees that financial scammers must be tried and put in prison      indeed  rasmussen  found  last month      two out of three  americans      believe the federal government has not been aggressive  enough in pursuing possible criminal behavior by some wall street  bankers  but    don’t feel that’s true and    are not sure      economists  agree      end – or at least rein in – the federal reserve     as i  pointed out  last month  americans are not happy with the federal reserve      cnn  notes       “we are seeing a level of enthusiasm for ron paul that  can be compared with president obama in  ″  said eric brakey  media  coordinator for nyc liberty hq  the grassroots organization hosting the  rally for the candidate  “congressman paul’s youth support is different  now than it was during his last presidential campaign  it’s more  organized and it’s picking up steam and continues to grow”     as the longtime congressman from texas stepped onto the stage  the crowd screamed with enthusiasm  the audience’s biggest reaction came when he spoke about ending the federal reserve   “the country has changed in the last four years  but my message hasn’t  changed” paul said  “the country is ripe for a true revolution”      at least     of the american people want a full audit of the fed   and  most were against reconfirming bernanke      indeed  as bloomberg  noted  last december      a majority of americans  are dissatisfied with the nation’s independent central bank  saying the  u s  federal reserve should either be brought under tighter political  control or abolished outright  a poll shows            americans across the political spectrum say the fed shouldn’t retain  its current structure of independence  asked if the central bank should  be more accountable to congress  left independent or abolished entirely     percent said it should be held more accountable and   percent that  it should be abolished  only   percent favor the status quo         economists  agree      respect the constitution and our liberty     as i  noted  in september  americans want our freedom back      americans have become much less tolerant of the wholesale  destruction of our constitutional freedoms in the name of fighting  terrorism     as talking points memo  notes       on the eve of the ten year anniversary of      the pew research center  has released new data  on americans’ reaction to the attacks  and the foreign and national  security policies pursued in the post     era  they show a country with  views that have evolved on the relationship between civil liberties and  the tools given to government to fight terrorism  and a disbelief that  the continuing wars in iraq and afghanistan helped to lessen the chance  there will be another terrorist attack on the united states     the pew survey showed a large shift in the number of americans who  are willing to see some of their civil liberties go out the window in  the name of fighting terrorism  directly after      americans were  willing to make the deal  as   percent thought it was necessary   against   percent who felt the opposite  now  only   percent felt that giving up some civil liberties is necessary to curb terrorism  with   percent against         end perpetual war     americans want to  put a stop to perpetual warfare       ron paul is  partly  gaining popularity because he is  against the never ending war on terror  and wants to bring the troops  home  americans are sick of the never ending  ever creeping war  see  this    this  and  this      as talking points memo  reported  earlier this month      “…only about a quarter say the wars in iraq      and  afghanistan      have lessened the chances of terrorist attacks in the  united states ” the pew report reads  “in both cases majorities say the  wars either have increased the risk of terrorism in this country or made  no difference ”     top american military leaders agree  saying that  the war on terror has weakened our national security       and a  cbs news poll  from november  th  found         three quarters of americans support us withdrawal from iraq     two thirds of americans believe the iraq war was not worth fighting     half of americans oppose us involvement in libya     more than half of americans want to end the war in afghanistan     seventy per cent of americans do not support military intervention to change dictatorships into democracies        of americans say iran can be contained via diplomacy     only    of americans support military intervention in iran        make elections fair     i  noted  last year that americans want fair elections      all americans agree that … there should be free and fair  elections  that is why – according to abc news and the washington post –     percent  of all americans oppose the supreme court’s recent decision allowing  unlimited campaign contributions  americans understand that – unless we  take the flood of money out of elections – washington will represent  special interests  and not us     and we all agree on publicly verifiable  automatically audited paper  ballot elections with reasonable id requirements  so that we assured  that no party can manipulate electronic voting results      keep poison out of our food and water     i  noted  last year that americans want safe food and water      americans want to be free to live our lives without being  poisoned  we agree on safe food  clean water and a healthy environment     for example  polls show        a large majority of americans want  strong food safety rules   and  want genetically modified foods to be labeled           most americans are worried about  water pollution           americans don’t want to be exposed to  toxic pollutants           if the american people agree on these core issues  why aren’t our demands being heard     if americans from across the spectrum agree  why aren’t these desires being implemented by our politicians     because our politicians are  bought and paid for … lock  stock and barrel      and the powers that be are good at using the  age old divide and conquer  trick to keep us weak  divided and fighting at each others’ throat … instead of for what we actually want     but ultimately  the main reason that we are impotent is that we don’t realize that the overwhelming majority of americans want the same things we do     indeed  most americans – conservatives and liberals – are    fed up    with  both  the mainstream republican  and  democratic parties  this is not surprising  given that neither party is  addressing the core demands of the american people as a whole     sure  liberals and conservatives will always disagree on some things   but if we realized how many core beliefs we share  we would  unite to take our country back  from those who disagree

      holiday travel plans change all the time  meaning lots of people will be spending lots of time on the phone trying to speak to a human being  and according to a new report  passengers on virgin america should have something to occupy themselves with while waiting on hold  as the average wait time for the carrier is longer than   minutes        in fact  according to the stellaservice study  not only is the     wait time to speak to a human being by far the longest among the   airlines in the survey  it s more than the next four worst airlines  wait times combined       and it wasn t just a few ridiculously long waits that threw off the study s numbers for virgin america    the survey shows that a whopping    of calls placed to the airline required longer than   minutes just to speak to a human being        the airline is currently advising passengers that wait times will likely be longer while it transitions to a new reservation system  but    whoa       on the opposite end of the spectrum  hawaiian airlines and alaska airlines took the top two spots with both carriers only having wait times in the   second range  the best of the country s major carriers was american  which clocked in at just over two minutes        the worst of the majors was united    more precisely  the continental call center for united    with an average wait time of      if it s any consolation  the united call center wasn t much better  average wait time          so it s not like either airline will definitely drag the other s phone banks into the mire       see below for the full results            handling the pre thanksgiving travel rush  stellaservice tests airlines on call support   stellaservice blog        
     it s been six months since  reporters in california first caught several walmart stores offering insufficient refunds on items returned with gift receipts   and then they  confirmed two months ago that it was still going at walmart s across the country   in spite of all this evidence that the nation s largest retailer needs to fix its gift receipt system  customers are still being screwed over when they try to return a gift       shellie bailey shah  a reporter for katu in portland  the one on the left of the map  recently did some gift shopping at her nearby walmart  target and fred meyer stores        when she went to return the purchases using gift receipts  the reporter had no problem getting the full amount back at both target and fred meyer  walmart was a very different story     the cashier at the return counter tried repeatedly to scan each of the   gift receipts  she told bailey shah that gift receipts  never work   and that the  system always has trouble with them   a statement walmart has since disputed       so instead  the clerk scanned the products  bar codes which brought up the sale price of each item  she told bailey shah that she d have to manually make adjustments  but somehow bailey shah still didn t end up with all her money  she spent      but was refunded       walmart pocketed             this is the identical issue that was reported by the california reporters and confirmed by news stations in texas and new jersey earlier this year  and walmart s response has been the same     there appeared to be a scanning issue that required our associate to process the return differently  we take these matters seriously and apologize for any inconvenience    it s our expectation to refund the original purchase price when returning an item with a gift receipt    we are reviewing that process to look for ways to make it more efficient and reliable for our customers        we think it s safe to say that this isn t a simple scanning issue but a serious systemic problem with walmart s receipt scanning process  one that the retailer doesn t seem to care much about fixing  even if it is employee error at the stores where customers have been having this problem  that just means that walmart is not training its staffers properly       thus  while we re not going to tell you to not do any holiday shopping at walmart  we do advise that you keep the actual receipt for any gifts you purchase there  and if a gift s recipient is thinking about returning the present  you should probably make them aware of the problems that walmart has been having with gift receipt returns                 walmart accused of shortchanging customers on gift receipt returns   katu com

     with so many people lining up at the airport today and tomorrow to fly home to stuff their stomachs with  well    stuffing  one u s  senator has introduced two pieces of legislation aimed at reining in the checked bag fees charged by airlines       senator mary landrieu of louisiana has come up with what she s called the airline passenger basic airline standards to improve customer satisfaction  basics  act  which would require airlines to allow passengers one checked and one carry on bag for free  the second piece of legislation that landrieu intends to introduce is the fair airline industry revenue  fair  act  which would impose additional fees on airlines that don t comply       explains the senator  who chairs the senate subcommittee on homeland security     when an airline advertises a flight  that is how much it should cost  plain and simple  passengers should not be charged additional fees for checked or carry on baggage  drinkable water or other reasonable requests           many airlines consider checking a bag not to be a right  but a privilege   and one with a hefty fee attached  the airline passenger basics act will guarantee passengers one checked bag without the financial burden of paying a fee  or the headache of trying to fit everything into a carry on       it will be interesting to see if this legislation actually has some legs or if it will just go around and round  like some unclaimed luggage on the carousel

     back in july  we discussed several reasons that  using only cash  for purchases makes financial sense  among the pluses were a lower risk of identity theft and simpler budgeting prospects        deliver away debt  checks in with another reason to stick with paper  since cash is so physically difficult to part with  it makes you rethink your shopping mentality  even for staples  for instance  you may start opting for small sized drinks rather than larges  or drifting toward generic products rather than brand names in order to make your cash stretch farther  you might even dream up ways to do without certain items or habits       that said  giving up the convenience of cards is easier said than done  the writer is embarking on a   day cash only experiment and promises to report back with the results        cash is king  isn t it    deliver away debt
