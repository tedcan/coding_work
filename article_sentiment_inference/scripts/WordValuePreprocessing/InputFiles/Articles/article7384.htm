<div class="content"><img src="http://consumerist.com/assets_c/2011/11/LCDTVBEMINE-thumb-240x166-55356.png"><p>Though you <a href="http://consumerist.com/2011/11/black-friday-discounts-may-not-be-the-best-time-to-buy-that-tv-you-want.html" target="_blank">might not see super-deep discounts on the best-reviewed TVs this Black Friday</a>, some experts are predicting that the average price of LCD TV sets will sink to an all-time low during the annual post-Thanksgiving buying bonanza.</p>

<p>Because the market is saturated by flat-screen HDTV sets, says <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/22/technology/lcd_tv_prices/index.htm?iid=HP_LN""target=_blank">CNNMoney</a>, there aren't as many people out there who still want to buy new TVs. Combine that with the economic downturn and shoppers knowing when to nab items at their lowest prices, and manufacturers are dropping their prices to boost sales.</p>

<blockquote>"It's a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Paul Gagnon, director of TV research at DisplaySearch. "But this year, softer demand is really taking a toll. Set makers' profitability is pretty terrible right now, so there's lots of pressure to have a good holiday."</blockquote>

<p>Predictions show some 32-inch LCD TVs going for as low as $200, with 60-inch sets going for as low as $600. Plasma screens are already more expensive, so those discounts won't be as steep as the LCD sets.</p>

<p>Low prices and less TVs sitting on warehouse shelves could also signal your choice being out of stock much faster than before as well, so shop early if you have a particular set you fancy.</p>
