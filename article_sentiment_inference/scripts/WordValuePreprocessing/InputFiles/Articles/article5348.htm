So now is this month’s U-turn: the reopening of talks with the Washington-based institution on securing a precautionary credit line (a kind of overdraft for solvent but cash-strapped countries).The move came after the Hungarian forint fell to a record low, successive bond auctions failed, and Standard & Poor’s, a ratings agency, said it was considering downgrading the country’s debt to junk status. The decision to go back to the IMF calmed the markets a little.

It blames its latest switch chiefly on turmoil in the euro zone.Fidesz, Mr Orban’s party, can justly claim to have inherited a mess from its Socialist predecessor.
