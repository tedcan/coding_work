<div class="content">Back on October 22nd, Occupy Chicago took up a new tactic. A week earlier, the protest group suffered its first setback when 175 demonstrators were arrested, quite peacefully, by the CPD at Grant Park. During the next Saturday march, speakers and chanters railed against the usual Wall St. suspects. But they also reserved time and ire for our new Mayor, blasting him for his role in the arrests and his policies. Since then---in demonstrations against Emanuel's business friends, his Aldermen, and the man himself---the protesters have taken a liking to the term "our 1% Mayor."

A similar wave swept across the other encampments. Bloomberg now has his drum circle, Jean Quan has her undesired attention in Oakland, and groups like Occupy D.C. are targeting issues (Walmart's expansion) that are essentially parochial. As city officials considered how to deal with occupiers, the occupiers turned on the cities.

And of course there is the whole police thing. I have a new piece up at GOOD that tries to tackle this issue, pulling back to look at the figures on city policing, crime and occupations:</div>
