<div class="content"><p>FOR decades the British have shrugged as their car manufacturers, energy firms, airports and even football teams have been bought by foreigners. On November 11th they lost their last major record label too, when EMI was sold.Terra Firma, a private-equity group, acquired EMI in 2007 with a plan to cut costs. But artists such as Radiohead left in protest at the stringent new regime and losses grew as the industry struggled with digitisation and rising piracy. Citigroup, the bank which financed Terra Firma’s acquisition and took control of EMI in February, has sold its recorded-music division to Universal Music, a French-owned label. Already the biggest company in the industry, Universal is expected to sell other assets to get around competition rules. EMI’s publishing arm, which owns the rights to over a million songs by artists old (The Pretenders) and new (Kasabian), went for £1.4 billion to a consortium led by Sony.EMI loomed over British pop for half a century. Its artists, including the Beatles, dominated the 1960s. It launched its own “British invasion” of America by buying Capitol Records (home to Frank Sinatra and the Beach Boys). When it fired a troublesome young act called the Sex Pistols, the rotters immortalised the label with a scathing song.  <div class="content-image-float clearfix">...</div></p></div>
