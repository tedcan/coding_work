<p>      SCIENTIST, engineer, musician and great artist, Leonardo da Vinci is the archetypal Renaissance man. This undisputed genius, who lived to be 67, was also one of history’s most accomplished underachievers. He started many projects he did not finish; he accepted commissions he never began; his many planned treatises remained just notes. Only 18 of his paintings survive. Half of them are included in a show that opened on November 9th at London’s National Gallery, making this the most important da Vinci display ever.The artist was born near Florence in 1452 and went to Milan at the age of 30. Luke Syson, the show’s curator, has come to believe that the freedom da Vinci enjoyed there as court painter to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, was the key that unlocked his genius.Mr Syson’s contention that Leonardo’s great breakthrough came in Milan and not later in Florence, as has generally been accepted until now, has captivated curators, collectors and museum directors who have been generous in loaning works to the show; from the Vatican, Prague, Cracow, Paris and the Royal Collection.All the pictures on show were painted during da Vinci’s 18 years in Milan. Never has it been possible to see so many of da Vinci’s paintings together....</p></div>
