<div class="content">WORDS to chill a heart:The crisis in Europe has begun to spill over into US bank lending, according to the latest survey of loan officers by the US Federal Reserve.Credit conditions have steadily eased since the end of the recession but that process almost ground to a halt in the last three months, with only five domestic banks out of 50 saying that they relaxed their standards for lending to large companies. Two banks had tightened conditions.The retrenchment in bank lending in America is small relative to that in Europe, which will help push the euro zone into recession and place pressure on its banking systems. Here is more interesting reading on ECB purchases of sovereign debt and the approaching threshold for sterilsation operations. I have to say, I'm puzzled. Recent developments in the euro zone seem incredibly negative to me. The probability of a reasonably orderly conclusion of the crisis appears to be falling. Yet equities aren't dropping; indeed, they're up from early September. Has the roadrunner sprinted off the cliff but not yet looked down? Or am I missing something?UPDATE: As commenters point out, I was dreadfully off in suggesting that the roadrunner may have run off a cliff rather than the coyote. Sincere apologies.</div>
