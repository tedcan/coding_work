<div class="content"><p><img src="http://cdn.heyitsfree.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/goob-has-hair.png" alt="Goob Has Hair" title="Goob Has Hair" width="475" height="317" class="darkimg" /></p>
<p>Yep, that’s a month of hair and a week of beard growth. And the eyebrows are back! I’m thankful for two out of those three.</p>
<p>I’m a private guy by nature. Heck, my sense of humor is a textbook case of having developed as a shielding mechanism. But it feels silly now that I ever debated keeping quiet on my health situation.</p>
<p>I was already in the middle of treatment when I wrote that post. I remember hitting publish then flopping over onto the bed for a smooth 10 hour nap. The next time I loaded HIF, the <a href="http://www.heyitsfree.net/2011/07/28/thank-you/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">comment count had skyrocketed</a> into the hundreds and I was shocked. I actually didn’t read them. I didn’t even look at them. I was terrified there’d be a heavy dose of negatvity (I mean, we’re talking about anonymous Internet comments here!) and I was already having enough trouble smiling.</p>
<p>The worst period of all occurred a week later when a perfect storm of side effects culminated. For three straight days, my dog and I lied in bed staring at one another, trying to will the other into venturing out to find food. I finally mustered the energy to get out of bed, but the kitchen felt lightyears away, so I sat down in front of my computer and loaded the comments.</p>
<p>You punks had me crying within minutes.</p>
<p>And that was it. That was the lowest I ever got and everything from there was an improvement. It sounds corny, but knowing I had thousands of complete strangers out there rooting for me was encouraging in a way I’d never thought possible. </p>
<p>Suddenly I wasn’t fighting this damn thing alone! I knew my family and friends had my back, but I never expected in a million years that people I’d never met would care as well. Every corner of the globe seemed to have a vested interest in vanquishing my tumors. I got emails from Canada, India, Ireland, Australia, Japan, and countless others. HIF doesn’t even post freebies for those countries!</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to reply to everyone individually, but I read and appreciated each and every comment and email.</p>
<p>And I’m thrilled to say that <a href="http://goobisgoofy.com/2011/11/11/hey-cancer-eat-it/" target="_blank">I’m now officially in remission</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’m sure I’ll say it again, but thank you. Y’all were phenomenal to me throughout this and knowing that I didn’t <em>have</em> to post freebies every day was a giant load off my back for a few months.  So, again, thank you for the kind words and thoughts and prayers and love and every ounce of goodwill channeled in my direction! It made a huge difference and I’ll never forget it. </p>
<p>Now go find some turkey, enjoy the day with family and friends, and have a Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
