<p><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/11/20/what-are-you-buying-on-black-friday/nice-socks/" rel="attachment wp-att-21992"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21992" title="nice-socks" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/nice-socks-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Is it sad to say that only until I started this post did I realize Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving?  No, seriously, I had no idea, which means that I never buy anything on Black Friday because I’m working or up in Tahoe baby!</p>
<p>Could there be anything more silly than taking a day off of work to go spend money?  It’s like taking yourself out of the work force for two years, losing all that lost income to go pay $50,000 a year in tuition to network and party it up at business school!  OK, maybe Black Friday shopping isn’t that dramatic.</p>
<p>The “<em>spend more, save more mentality</em>” is not good for your pocket book.  How about, “<em>Let me look and buy what I really need.  And if I don’t really need it, I won’t buy it!</em>”  That’s a much better mindset, and you know it!</p>
<p>Now that I realize Black Friday is supposed to be a special day of sales, I’ve begun to comb through a list of things that I may want to buy.  Of course by the time I get off work, none of the items will be available, and the parking lot will be a zoo.  There aren’t many things I want to buy, so maybe you guys can give some consumption inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>MY BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING LIST<span id="more-21985"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>* Work socks.</strong> Gotta have me some fresh socks!  Maybe I can get a 2 for 1 special!  Cost: $30.  Likelihood of buying: 95%.</p>
<p><strong>* Holiday cards, books, toys:</strong> The best gifts are hand written or hand made.  Guess I’ll be writing a lot of personal cards and knitting some nice scarfs!  Good thing I got a bunch of nice ones from Santorini already made.  As adults, we don’t really give or receive any presents anymore do we?  I know I don’t.  Gifts are mostly just for the nieces, nephews, and cousins under 21 years old.  Cost: $400.  Likelihood of buying: 100%.</p>
<p><strong>* Casual dress shoes.</strong> Burning through my casual work shoes like a marshmallow on a stick.  Love them soft, handmade shoes by Tod’s have to admit.  Quality and comfort over quantity and discomfort! Cost: $300.  Likelihood of buying: 65%.</p>
<p><strong>* 40″ LED TV</strong> to replace my 6 year old 40″ projection TV with green spots in the living room.  About two years ago, the picture started greening out and it’s gotten progressively worse.  Its just such a PITA to replace everything since I’ll have to get a new receiver and wiring as well.  Beside, I have another TV which is fine.  Cost: $700 for the TV, and $500 for a new receiver and wiring.  Likelihood of buying: 50%.</p>
<p><strong>* A 13″ MacBook Air.</strong>  I’ve got a 3 year old MacBook with upgraded 4 gigs of RAM.  The problem is I only have a 120GB hard drive which is now full after my trip to Greece.  I could get a backup drive for $150-$250 as Sydney from Untemplater sas, or perhaps I can get the $1,600 version of the MB Air with a 256GB hard drive.  Damn, that’s expensive!  Even with the supposed 10% off on Black Friday, that just saves me tax.  How do people afford such costs nowadays?  I’m probably going to use my current computer for at least another year.  Likelihood of buying: 20%.</p>
<p><strong>* A trip to Hawaii.</strong>  If Alaska Air, Hawaiian Air, or United Air have a last minute special to Honolulu, I’m there!  Round-trip tickets from San Francisco cost $640 on average during the winter, and $1,000 during the holidays.  If by some miracle prices are cut in half, I will go for my final week of vacation with no guilt, no doubt.  Likelihood: 50%.</p>
<p><strong>* 2012 Porsche 911 Turbo in black.</strong>  At a cost of $160,000, what a bargain!  I could gun the car over famous cable-car California St. and catch 25 feet of air.  Alas, I don’t make $1.6 million a year, so that would violate the Financial Samurai 1/10th rule for car buying.  See folks who disagree with the 1/10th rule?  It’s so easy to follow!</p>
<p><strong>IN SEARCH FOR DESIRES</strong></p>
<p>I just spent $395 bucks on two tennis rackets which are softer on the arm.  Meanwhile, I had to <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/11/18/fix-the-car-or-buy-a-new-one/" target="_blank">change the brakes and battery</a> on Moose to the tune of $795.  Hence, if I were to buy everything above for $3,300, the total two month expenditure would come up to around $4,500!  What’s more interesting is that the ratio of spending on others, to spending on myself is pathetically selfish!</p>
<p>The reality is, I’m probably just going to get new socks, cards, and toys for the kids and that’s it.  My casual work shoes will just be resoled for $40 bucks and I’ll just live with what I’ve got.  I really, REALLY hate crowds and can imagine a scenario where I’m at Best Buy trying to save $300 on a TV, and Moose’s door gets dinged in the parking lot costing $500 to repair! I’d rather just sit at home in my pajamas and pretend to shop on Cyber Monday!</p>
<p><em>How about you guys?  Any big plans for Black Friday?  Are you spending more this year or less?  How much do you think you’ll spend on Black Friday and the entire winter holiday?</em></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sam</p>
