<div class="content">ABRAHAM TAKURA leans over a jute sack and holds his Motorola smartphone in front of a white label, on which are printed a bit of text and a few black lines. It is not that Mr Takura has a penchant for dull photographs: the lines are a barcode, which he is scanning. His phone duly records important data and sends them to a server in the German town of Walldorf: this sack of shea nuts, belonging to Fati Karimu, from Chamera Fong, has been delivered to the warehouse in Janga.Janga, in northern Ghana, home to about 3,000 people, is reached by a spine-jarring 40-minute ride along an unmade, red-earth road. Water has to be obtained from the pump, but telecommunications are on tap. A red-and-white steel tower, the ubiquitous sign of Africa’s leap into the mobile-phone age, rises above the homes of mud and thatch, breeze-block and corrugated metal.Janga’s tower has been here for a few years at most. Its women have been gathering shea nuts from the bush for generations. It is hard, dangerous work: there are snakes in the grass and the nuts are collected after they fall. But they are an essential source of income. The nuts are dried and made into shea butter, of which most is used in confectionery and some in cosmetics. It is said to do wonders for dry skin.</div>
