<div class="content"><p>CENTURIES before Columbus, Viking adventurers ruled the North Atlantic. They sailed as far as America without the aid of magnetic compasses, which was no mean feat. They were, however, assisted in their travels by another sort of magical device. According to the sagas they had stones which could point to the sun, even when the sky was cloudy.No such sunstone has survived. But Guy Ropars of the University of Rennes, in France, thinks he knows what they were. He and his colleagues have been experimenting with a mineral called Iceland spar. Their results, just published in the <em class="Italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>, suggest they are on to something.The passage of sunlight through the air polarises it. That means light from the sky itself points towards the sun, if you have the necessary equipment to detect the polarisation. Dr Ropars has shown that a piece of Iceland spar is sufficient.Iceland spar is a form of calcite that splits light into two beams. If the light is polarised, there is only one way to orient the crystal to produce beams of equal intensity. Find this orientation by looking through the crystal at the sky at a time when you can see the sun, mark the sun’s direction on the crystal, and your mark will always point towards the sun when you match the beams from even a tiny patch of blue in an otherwise overcast sky. Dr Ropars’s experiments suggest...</p></div>
