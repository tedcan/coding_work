<div class="content"><p></p><p>While I’ve already offered my suggestions for <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/best-holiday-toys/">this year’s best holiday toys</a>, not everyone on your Christmas or gift-giving list is a child. You may have a special adult someone on your list who would appreciate something more useful. Although it’s early in the holiday shopping season, at least for me, some of the best deals are already starting to materialize, well before Black Friday.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a great Christmas gift for one of your favorite people, consider one of these Christmas gift ideas under $100. Of course, these apply as well to Hanukkah or any other gift-giving activities you might partake in before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Have any good suggestions? Please leave them in the comments and I’ll add the ones I like to my list.</p>
<h3>Gift ideas under $100: Around the house</h3>
<p><strong>1. Dremel Multi-Max Oscillating Tool Kit</strong> (Home Depot, $99.00). “The Dremel Multi-Max 2.3 Amp MM20 Oscillating Tool Kit incorporates a powerful, efficient motor that provides cool, smooth operation under load. This versatile tool features a compact design that makes it easy to handle in tight spaces..” For anyone who likes or wants to do work around the house.</p>
<p><strong>2. Black & Decker B&D Convection Toaster Oven</strong> (Sears, $95.63). This convection toaster oven also comes with a rotisserie capability. I need to replace my toaster oven, and this is a capable option.</p>
<p><strong>3. Task Force 204-Piece Standard/Metric Mechanics Tool Set with Case</strong> (Lowe’s, $89.98). With 204 pieces, this tool set is complete for any would-be handyman or handywoman, yet it is still portable.</p>
<p><strong>4. Pure Beech Jersey Knit Sheet Set, 100% Modal</strong> (Bed, Bath and Beyond, $29.00 – $79.00). “The softness of these extremely soft and light silk-like sheets is reminiscent of your favorite T-shirt, offering incomparable comfort.” I’ve been a fan of jersey cotton sheets for several years. I find jersey cotton to be much more comfortable than sateen or other bed sheets.</p>
<p><strong>5. Framed art</strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D381142011%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_381142011_ln%26keywords%3Dart%26qid%3D1290795607%26h%3D3cbef9414a8ebe7a2df41e419e4f73ad330f5b67%26rh%3Dn%253A381142011%252Ck%253Aart&tag=consumerismco-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Amazon, up to $99.99</a>). Adding art to the walls adds color and excitement to any room in the house. If you don’t know an artist willing to create work for you, shop for framed art.</p>
<p><strong>6. Merkur Shaving Gift Set</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B0010Y1KYA">Amazon, $106.50</a>). “The set includes a chrome stand that holds a Merkur Classic Safety Razor and a fabulous badger Shaving Brush with a Chrome Handle. Also included in the set is an elegant Chrome Bowl that holds a Colonel Conk Shaving Soap.” Since April, I’ve been <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/getting-a-better-and-cheaper-shave/">shaving the old-fashioned way</a>, with a badger-hair brush, shaving soap, and a safety razor. My face has never felt healthier and I get a smooth shave. Add some inexpensive Feather blades and have smooth skin all day.</p>
<p><strong>7. Helen Of Troy Hotspa Professional Ultimate Foot Bath</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B00027UPRY">Amazon, $95.93</a>). “Ozone (active oxygen) helps to control, reduce and eliminate bacteria Motorized Pedicenter rotates with the press of a foot.” These devices are quite relaxing, whether you’ve been on your feet all day teaching, hiking, or giving presentations to the board of directors.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sterling Silver 1/8 Carat t.w. Diamond Heart Bracelet</strong> (Kay, $99.99). “Heart-shaped sterling silver links accented with round diamonds create playful style in this bracelet for her. One-eighth carat total diamond weight. 7″ in length. With lobster clasp.” For any women who like jewelery.</p>
<h3>Gift ideas under $100: Electronics</h3>
<p><strong>9. Sony BDP-S380 Blu-ray Disc Player</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B004K1EOAC">Amazon, $98.00</a>). “Enjoy Blu-ray Disc movies in brilliant high-definition resolution or upscale the quality of your DVDs to near HD. Instantly stream a wide variety of movies, TV shows, live sports, videos, and music from Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, Hulu Plus and many more.” If you have a high-definition television, you must adopt Blu-Ray and replace your DVD player. There is simple no comparison between (even up-converted) standard definition and high bit-rate Blu-Ray video and audio.</p>
<p><strong>10. Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W530 14.1 MP Digital Still Camera</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B004H8FNN0">Amazon, $99.99</a>). “Shoot more life with the Sony DSC-W530.  Capture landscapes with one touch using Sweep Panorama, get that perfect portrait with Smile Shutter, snap wider scenes with the 26mm wide angle lens, get high quality photos with 14.1 megapixels, and automatically get clear shots with SteadyShot image stabilization and iAuto; all in a sleek little design.” This camera features a Carl Zeiss lens, offering a great quality picture sure to beat the camera built into your phone.</p>
<p><strong>11. Roku 2</strong> (Roku, $59.99 to $99.99). “With Roku, get instant access to tons of entertainment — with more choices added all the time.” This device allows you to watch any media content on your (most likely high-definition) television, accessing the internet wirelessly from anywhere in your house. It seamlessly links to your Netflix and Hulu content as well as many other services.</p>
<p><strong>12. Garmin nüvi 1300 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B001U0O7T4">Amazon, $98.94</a>). “The thin nüvi 1300 has a widescreen display, yet it’s slim and light enough to take along on all your travels. This affordable GPS comes with regional mapping, announces streets by name, offers pedestrian navigation options and calculates a more fuel-efficient route with ecoRoute.” I’m looking for a new GPS navigator for my car, as I’ve been using my phone since my last device was stolen.</p>
<p><strong>13. Kindle Touch Wi-Fi, 6″ E Ink Display</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B005890G8Y">Amazon, $99.00</a>). I have been using my iPad for reading books purchased via Kindle, but if you have no need for an iPad and just want the ability to access your library from anywhere, choose the Kindle. Now members of Amazon Prime can read books without paying for each.</p>
<p><strong>14. Coby DVD938 5.1-Channel DVD Home Theater System</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B001PA94TC">Amazon, $90.01</a>). “Dynamic sound meets sleek design in Coby’s DVD938 home theater system, which includes a progressive scan DVD player plus a 5.1-channel home theater speaker system (subwoofer and five satellite speakers).” This is a bargain if you don’t need HDMI and you’re looking for compatibility with USB players, SD cards, or karaoke.</p>
<h3>Gift ideas under $100: Fun stuff</h3>
<p><strong>15. Tauntaun Sleeping Bag</strong> (ThinkGeek, $99.99). “In the sub-zero wasteland of the planet Hoth, only the strong survive… and of course those lucky Jedi protected by the thick skin of a Tauntaun.” Any Star Wars fan, adult or child, would appreciate the comfort of avoiding the cold by sleeping inside a tauntaun. ThinkGeek offers lots of gifts for science fiction and fantasy geeks and tech nerds.</p>
<p><strong>16. Bicycle Premium Mega Masters Poker Chip Set</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B001LRPX4Y">Amazon, $99.95</a>). “The Bicycle Mega Masters Poker Set is a premium poker set for the poker enthusiast. It includes a handmade, high-lacquered wooden case with 500 11.5-gram Bicycle clay filled poker chips in a four-color assortment of red, blue, black, and green… [and] two decks of Premium Bicycle brand playing cards.” Invite your friends over and lose more money to them than the cost of buying this set.</p>
<p><strong>17. Halex Premium Vivace 113mm Bocce Set</strong> (BocceBallSets.com, $94.98). With this set, you can entertain your friends with both backyard games: bocce and croquet. Best to buy these sets during the off-season for the best prices. This set normally costs $140.</p>
<p><strong>18. Bob Ross Deluxe Oil Painting Set In Wood Box</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/amazon/B001192OR6">Amazon, $85.00</a>). “Bob Ross Art Sets enable the beginner artist to create a beautiful oil painting through Bob’s easy and informative instruction methods and top-quality materials. This Deluxe Art Set contains everything needed to get started in the Bob Ross ‘Wet on Wet’ technique.” Thankfully, this set comes with an instructional DVD. You recipient will be on his or her way to creating masterpieces.</p>
<h3>Gift ideas under $100: Financial stuff</h3>
<p>This is a personal finance blog, after all.</p>
<p><strong>19. $100 Treasury Bond</strong> (TreasuryDirect, $100). TreasuryDirect offers gift functionality, so as long as you have an account and have the Social Security Number of your recipient, you can give the gift of a savings bond, a low risk investment that will earn interest over time.</p>
<p><strong>20. Stock</strong> (ShareBuilder, $100). If you would like to give someone a financial gift, particularly a young individual who has an interest in the stock market but is a beginner, consider a ShareBuilder gift card to get them started. This is a good time to introduce young investors to the concept of transaction fees, as well.</p>
<p><strong>21. 2011 United States Mint Silver Proof Set</strong> (United States Mint, $67.95). “The 2010 United States Mint Silver Proof Set contains all 14 circulating coins in stunning proof condition displayed in three protective lenses, each bearing the S mint mark of the United States Mint at San Francisco.” Great for collectors or non-collectors, and it can inspire and create young numismatists.</p>
<p><strong>22. Kids’ Savings Account</strong> (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/go/ing-direct-savings/" target=_"blank">ING Direct, $25 and up</a>). <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2398862-10898238" target=_"blank">Opening a new ING Direct Kids Savings Account</a> is a great way to teach a child or teenager good saving habits and concepts like compound interest.</p>
