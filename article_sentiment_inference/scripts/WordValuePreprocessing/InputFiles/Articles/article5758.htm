<div class="content">IT'S an uncomfortable feeling, when you've written about a subject dozens of times over the years, to suddenly be brought up short by an ontological question. Yet that's what's happened to me over the past few days, trawling around the eco-smug cities of Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas, talking to people about green jobs. The question is: what is a green job, exactly?I've always thought about "green jobs" as the category covering work with explicit and intentional environmental benefits. Working on a wind turbine: yes. Making solar panels: of course. Organic farming: okay. Farming in general: not really. Teaching science in a public high school: an admirable endeavour, but not a green job. But there are lots of jobs that fall in a gray area. Tofu can be swapped for emissions-heavy beef; does growing soybeans count? What if you manufacture bicycles? The more you think about this, the more uncertain you become. Most jobs can be greened or at least greenwashed; in Portland, for example, there is a vegan strip club. On the other hand, you could make a Malthusian argument that no job is green because anything that creates value for people helps them and facilitates their attrition campaign against the earth.</div>
