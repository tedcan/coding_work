<div class="content"><p></p><p><em>While saving money, reducing expenses, and earning income all help improve your net worth, these tactics often ignore the larger picture. Improving your personal human capital is like a form of insurance; you’re protecting your ability to increase your net worth over a long period of time. <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/10-ways-to-boost-your-human-capital/">Boosting your human capital</a> through gaining education, adding variety to your experiences, and cultivating your network can help to ensure you’re in a better financial position in the future.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/jung-typology-and-finance-introversion-vs-extraversion/">I’m what Carl Jung would call an Introvert.</a> To be more specific, in the variety of corporate psychological analyses I’ve participated in over the past fifteen years, my result is generally halfway between Introvert and Extravert, though I identify more with the Introvert qualities. This doesn’t mean I always prefer to work by myself or spend time alone; it means that I can draw energy from independent thinking. I am comfortable in social situations with large groups of people as well as working in teams, but rather than drawing energy from this type of socialization, it draws energy from me.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2889883615_f5dea21318_b1-300x199.jpg" alt="People" title="People" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16370" />As a result of this energy drain, I haven’t put as much effort into networking as an independent business owner like myself should have. I’ve been building online communities of various types since at least 1990, but I haven’t done a great job with maintaining relationships over time. From a social perspective, I prefer to have a few close contacts than a large number of acquaintances. Not only does this make it difficult for people to get close to me, but it has perhaps damaged my personal human capital.</p>
<h3>When to say yes</h3>
<p>The overworked and overscheduled business owner receives standard advice: “Know when to say no.” One person cannot do everything, and those who have shown themselves to be experts are often faced with ceaseless requests for assistance. Focusing effort on the 20 percent of requests that have 80 percent of the most relevance to the expert’s own needs, an approach that borrows from the <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/the-pareto-principle-when-to-apply-when-to-ignore/">Pareto principle</a>, might benefit from lighter schedules but might miss the opportunity to have a significant effect on someone’s life.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that it could be damaging to over-promise and under-deliver, I take the approach of responding to as many requests as possible, looking at each as an opportunity to connect with someone I may not know about. </p>
<h3>Both depth and breadth are important</h3>
<p>I mentioned above that I’m more comfortable with fewer close relationships than more superficial connections. This limits my capacity for improving my overall human capital. The most beneficial network contains both deep relationships and a wide network. </p>
<p>An individual beginning a new business as a landlord or real estate investor is a good example of someone whose human capital increases significantly with a wide network. In order for an investment to be profitable, unless the investor intends to spend all of his time and effort handling every detail regarding the property, he or she needs to know a variety of people in positions to help. While one can find plumbers, contractors, painters, property managers, and real estate agents by searching online, the best help — and the better deals — would come from people the investor knows personally. Recommendations from friends or other investors could fill in some holes in the network, and every interaction through a recommendation can grow this network.</p>
<p>For someone building a photography business, initial help could come from the deeper relationships in the individual’s inner circle, those who would trust the photographer enough to help build an initial portfolio and be willing to recommend the photographer to friends in the early stages of the business.</p>
<h3>The value of online networking tools</h3>
<p>LinkedIn has become the one location for the best business-focused networking. Despite this, I am not convinced that online-only networking — or just having a massive contact list — is valuable. I receive connection requests every day from people I’ve never communicated with, whether in person or through email. I don’t see the benefit of growing the list just to have a high connection count, just like the purpose of earning more money or reducing expenses is <em>not</em> just to have a larger bank balance. </p>
<p>As LinkedIn has grown, more features seem to invite unwanted messages and self-aggrandizement. I see LinkedIn as an effective contact management system, where you can be sure your most important contacts also offer their latest information. This is much more efficient than maintaining a Little Black Book when contacts frequently change jobs, positions, email addresses, and phone numbers.</p>
<h3>Professional organizations</h3>
<p>Starting in college, you can join professional organizations that provide opportunities to expand your network and open opportunities that might not have been available otherwise. As a music education major, I re-established the university’s collegiate chapter of a major national organization related to the field. Had I remained in this field, I would have been able to draw upon the contacts I established at this organization for professional opportunities. (You never know what path your life might take, but it doesn’t hurt to prepare for the path you intend to take at any particular time.)</p>
<p>In my career as an independent financial blogger, it was rewarding to establish an informal association of like-minded writers. As a small, tightly-knit group, we could easily share ideas and best practices to help our budding businesses grow.</p>
<h3>Mentoring relationships</h3>
<p>Focusing on the depth rather than breadth of connections, the relationship between a mentor and protege can be a helpful for building personal human capital. Seeking a respected individual in your field to play the role of a mentor can help you have an avenue for asking direct questions where the answers will help you reach your goals. No matter where you are in life, there is always someone from whom you can learn. Even the most successful individuals in the world find time to speak to people they respect to come away from a discussion with more ideas or tools.</p>
<p>At the same time, being a mentor can be very rewarding. Often, a protege asks a question that forces you to solidify your thoughts and opinions. By talking through your approach to any particular issue helps you think about details that may seem self-explanatory. In the variety of relationships in which I’ve served as a mentor, I’ve found that I’ve learned more about myself and my life and business have both improved as a result.</p>
<p>One danger in this relationship is being defined by the role in nominal terms. Mentors can learn from proteges. Everyone has something to offer.</p>
<h3>Five tips for building an effective human network</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Don’t present yourself as someone you’re not.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocate.</strong> Don’t take more from a relationship than you’re prepared to give. Say yes often.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on depth and breadth.</strong> Don’t just be a contact collector. Add depth to the relationships that matter most.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitate connections.</strong> Rather than focusing solely on the relationships that will help you, note where your contacts will benefit from building a relationship with your other connections.</li>
<li><strong>Follow meetings with a message.</strong> Responding or connecting quickly after a meeting will help build relationships faster.</li>
</ul>
