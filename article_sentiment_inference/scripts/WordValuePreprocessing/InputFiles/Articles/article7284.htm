<p>Let’s say you’re on a hot date and roll up in the Corolla to your favorite five star restaurant, Olive Garden.  You slip the valet a $5 for the $4 valet fee and tell him to “keep the change” so he can keep it up front.  The hostess greets you coldly and says there’s no table.  You pull out another crisp $5 dollar bill and she changes her mind and seats you right away.  Normally you just order water, but tonight you get a little crazy with their $3 Bud Lights!  And afterward, since you two are all tipsy now, it’s Nintendo Wii action all night long!  Now that’s Triple AAA.</p>
<p><strong>THE TEMPTATION OF CHEAP MONEY IS STRONG</strong></p>
<p>Triple AAA is tempting me right now as I consider doing a cash-out refinance for one of the rental properties at 3.375% from 4% (thank you Bengenie).  If you’re in a oppressively high federal income tax bracket, you might consider doing a cash-out refinance to <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/09/15/cash-out-mortgage-refinancing-as-a-way-to-lower-your-taxes/" target="_blank">lower your income tax</a> bill.</p>
<p>Since I’m pretty sure I’ll be in a lower income tax bracket during retirement (as will you most likely), I figured why not extract cash out of a rental property and increase my interest expense to shield my rental income.  With 5-year rental property money at only 3.375%, it would be foolish not to at least consider the option.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/09/29/how-to-get-anapartment-in-hot-rental-market/" target="_blank">rental market</a> is hotter than the 49ers and I was able to increase my asking rent price by 12% last month from a year ago.  My realtor friends implored me to raise the rent by another couple hundred bucks, but I didn’t have the heart since I had already put the price out there on Craigslist, and I found a potentially ideal tenant.</p>
<p>By refinancing, the cash flow for the rental property increased by another 23% for a total increase of 35%.  Yet, despite this increased cash-flow, I thought long and hard whether increasing my debt to then negate my cash flow increase was the right financial decision in this low interest rate environment.  Doing a cash-out refinance is definitely something to consider if you have a hefty amount of equity in your property.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO DECIDE ON A CASH-OUT REFINANCE<span id="more-21895"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>* What are you going to do with the money? </strong> If you have no good plans for the money that will return at least the cost of your mortgage, then you probably shouldn’t cash-out. CD and savings rates are still much lower than your mortgage rates, so you will be losing money every month you don’t put it to good use.  Nothing is a guaranteed return, so think long and hard before plopping that cash down on something that sounds so good.</p>
<p><strong>* What’s your outlook on the property market? </strong> If you think the markets are going to tank 90%, then by all means cash out!  You don’t want to see your equity disappear.  If you can legally cash out and have free cash in your bank account, then please do so before it disappears.  In the event of a market crash, it is then up to you to decide whether you should pay your mortgage or not.  You should if you live in a recourse state, and maybe not if you live in a non-recourse state.  Just don’t brag about it and try and profiteer if you do welch on your debt!</p>
<p><strong>* How disciplined are you? </strong> Some people go crazy irresponsible when they have a sudden influx of cash.  If you are making say $100,000 a year with $50,000 in savings, could you handle an extra $200,000 in the bank after a cash-out refinance?  Would you not be tempted to go on some fancy vacation or buy a car you’ve always wanted?  If so, then you shouldn’t do a cash-out refi since you wouldn’t have spent that money if you didn’t get the injection.  I have a weakness for nice vacations and cars, even though I haven’t bought one in 4 years and drive a beater.</p>
<p><strong>* How much money are you making?</strong>  If you already have a high amount of cash-flow or have a a healthy year-end bonus every year and don’t plan to get fired, then perhaps you really shouldn’t do a cash-out refinance.  For example, let’s say you want to cash-out $100,000, but you can save $100,000 every year.  If this is the case, why bother?</p>
<p><strong>* Understand the rate differential</strong>.  My banker said I could do a cash-out refinance if I wanted to, but then said my mortgage would have to be re-underwritten, and the rate would go up.  Funny how they didn’t tell me this before my appraisal.  I was thinking to myself if I borrow more money, I could get a lower rate!  Silly me.  It’s quite the opposite.  This higher rate was the straw that broke the camels back as he tried a little bait and switch.  I’m a rate seeker.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Although it would be nice to have several hundred thousand extra in cash since <strong><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/10/17/thrill-of-paying-down-debt-and-having-no-money-addicting/" target="_blank">I’m broke</a></strong>, I felt it wise to keep paying down debt.  <em>Stay the course</em>, I frequently tell myself.  Making it rain at Olive Garden is fun.  Driving a new Toyota Corolla is exhilarating. Going out with women who just want you for your money and big brain is titillating.  But sooner or later the thrills go away and you’re left with a big hole in your pocket if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>Cash-out refinancing is just accounting.  You either have cash in the bank or equity in the house.  The temptation just gets that much greater when you can actually use it.  Housing will continue to get better over the next 5-10 years.  If I didn’t, I would take the money out in a heart beat and maybe even pull a <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/11/16/never-rent-again/" target="_blank">Carl Richards</a>!</p>
<p><em><strong>Readers</strong>, have any of you ever done a cash-out refinance?  Were you happy with your decision?  Could you handle not going crazy with a sudden new injection of cash?  Do you like triple AAA?</em></p>
