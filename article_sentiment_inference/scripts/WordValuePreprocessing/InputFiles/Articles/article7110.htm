The development set the stage for oral arguments by March and a decision in late June, in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign…</p>  <p>…</p>  <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/11/13/us/politics/challenges-to-the-health-law.html">Appeals from three courts had been vying for the justices’ attention</a>, presenting an array of issues beyond the central one of whether Congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so-called individual mandate. </p>  <p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from just one decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, <a name='more'></a>  the only one so far striking down the mandate. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/us/13health.html">The decision</a>, from a divided three-judge panel, said the mandate overstepped Congressional authority and could not be justified by the constitutional power “to regulate commerce” or “to lay and collect taxes.” </p>  <p>The appeals court went no further, though, severing the mandate from the rest of the law. </p>  <p>On Monday, the justices agreed to decide not only whether the mandate is constitutional but also whether, if it is not, how much of the balance of the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, must fall along with it. </p>  <p>…</p>  <p>On Monday, the justices agreed to consider that question. The justices also said they would consider an intriguing threshold issue.</p>  <p>In September, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/health/policy/09virginia.html">ruled that it was premature to decide the case</a> in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, a federal law that bars suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.” The Supreme Court had interpreted the term “tax” very broadly for purposes of the law. </p>  <p>If the Fourth Circuit ruling is correct, individuals may not challenge the individual mandate until the first penalty is due in April 2015. On Tuesday, a dissenting judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/health/policy/appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law.html">also endorsed that position</a>. </p> </blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5048766-5486500225130429319?l=www.angrybearblog.com' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">
