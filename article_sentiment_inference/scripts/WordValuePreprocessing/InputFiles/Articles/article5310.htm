<div class="content"><p>OF THE WORLD’s 774m illiterate adults two-thirds are women, a share that has remained unchanged for the past two decades. In rich countries pretty much everyone, male or female, can read and write (though employers sometimes wonder). In developing regions such as South Asia, sub-Saharan and north Africa and the Middle East, men are still much more likely to be literate than women. But girls everywhere are beginning to catch up. Across the emerging world, 78% of them are now at primary school, an only slightly smaller proportion than boys (82%). At secondary level enrolment remains lower and girls are further behind, but things are getting better there too.Education for girls in poor countries has all sorts of desirable consequences: not only the likelihood of a better job with higher pay, but also of better health, a later marriage, fewer children and being able to provide better care for the family. Aid donors are making a special effort to give girls’ education a push. Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, has taken to saying that investing in girls is not just a good thing but a smart thing to do.  <div class="content-image-float clearfix">...</div></p></div>
