  </div>WHEN HILDA SOLIS was at high school, a male career adviser told her mother that the girl was not college material; she should consider becoming a secretary. Hilda was furious. One of seven children born to working-class immigrant parents, she had high ambitions. She did go to college, became a lawmaker in California and is now secretary of labour, the first Latina to hold a cabinet post in America’s federal government.On Tarja Halonen’s first day at work in the legal department of a trade union she answered the phone to a man who, hearing a female voice, asked to speak to one of the lawyers. She informed him that he was speaking to one. Things got better after that. Following her stint as a lawyer she served in Finland’s parliament for over 20 years. Since 2000 she has been the country’s president, the first female in the job.Both these incidents happened in the 1970s. They would be much less likely today, partly because political correctness has made people more cautious (not least thanks to a series of high-profile sex-discrimination court cases) but mainly because attitudes really have changed.
