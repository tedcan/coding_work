<div class="content"><p>I have repeatedly demonstrated that – despite the false  divide-and-conquer tactics of the mainstream parties and mainstream  media – <a title="the overwhelming majority of Americans agree on the most important issues facing our country" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/if-the-occupy-movement-and-tea-party-join-together-we-can-end-the-malignant-partnership-between-big-government-and-big-corporations-which-is-destroying-america.html">the overwhelming majority of Americans agree on the most important issues facing our country</a>. See <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/the-occupy-movement-is-protesting-the-same-thing-that-the-founding-fathers-protested-at-the-boston-tea-party.html">this</a>.</p>
<h3>NO MORE BAILOUTS!</h3>
<p>As I’ve noted since <a title="2008" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/09/people-who-opposed-the-bailout-are-not-to-blame-for-the-stock-market-crash.html">2008</a>, Americans are united in their overwhelming disapproval for bailouts to the big banks.</p>
<p>This has remained true right up to today.</p>
<p>As Rassmussen found only last month (as summarized by <a title="KXLF news" href="http://www.kxlf.com/news/rasmussen-reports-survey-says-most-americans-oppose-government-bailouts/" target="_blank">KXLF news</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’sRasmussen Reports survey finds that most Americans don’t like bailouts for financial institutions.</p>
<p>60% Oppose Financial Bailouts; 74% Say Wall Street Benefited Most</p>
<p>Survey of 1,000 American Adults</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>• Just 20% think it was a good idea  for the government to provide bailout funding to banks and other  financial institutions, but 60% say otherwise.</p>
<p>• While many activists try to link the Republican Party and Wall Street, Republicans think the bailouts were a bad idea by an eight-to-one margin.</p>
<p>• Those not affiliated with either major party think they were a bad  idea by a four-to-one margin. Democrats are much more evenly divided.  Thirty-four percent (34%) of those in the president’s party say the  bailouts were a good idea while 42% disagree.</p>
<p>• Overall, 68% believe that most of the bailout money went to the very people who created the nation’s ongoing economic crisis, but 12% disagree and 21% aren’t sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent <a title="notes" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/how-wall-street-really-views-the-protesters/2011/11/19/gIQAfvSObN_blog.html" target="_blank">notes</a>,  the recent proposal from lobbyists to the American Bankers Association  recommending ways to co-opt the Occupy movement accurately stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well-known Wall Street companies stand at the nexus of  where OWS protestors and the Tea Party overlap on angered populism. Both  the radical left and the radical right are channeling broader  frustration about the state of the economy and share a mutual anger over  TARP and other perceived bailouts. This combination has the potential  to be explosive later in the year when media reports cover the next  round of bonuses and contrast it with stories of millions of Americans  making do with less this holiday season.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Except that it is the majority of Americans – not “extremists” on either side of the aisle – that share this anger).</p>
<p>The “Tea Party” movement was centered on the protesting government bailouts of the giant banks, before it was hijacked by the mainstream Republican party, Sarah Palin, Neocons and others. See <a title="this" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=3Sgym2OL4tc" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://tickerforum.org/cgi-ticker/akcs-www?post=79282&amp;page=1" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.fedupusa.org/about-us/#Who" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.americanpreppersnetwork.com/2010/02/who-started-tea-party-movement.html" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_protests#cite_note-79" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Ron Paul <a title="said" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z91gTaEbnvk&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">said</a> last month at a GOP debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bailouts came from both parties…. If you have to give  money out, you should give it to people losing their mortgages, not to  the banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>And one of the most common sayings of Occupy Wall Street protesters is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banks got bailed out. We got sold out</p></blockquote>
<p>(See <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/obama-heckled-for-allowing-police-brutality-against-protesters.html">this</a> and <a title="this" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Banks+got+bailed+out.+We+got+sold+out%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">this</a>.)</p>
<h3>END CRONY CAPITALISM!</h3>
<p>I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/we-can-fix-america-if-we-focus-on-what-all-americans-liberals-and-conservatives-want.html">noted</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>A <a title="Rassmussen poll" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2010/only_21_say_u_s_government_has_consent_of_the_governed" target="_blank">Rassmussen poll</a> conducted in February found:</p>
<blockquote><p>70% [of all voters] believe that the government and big  business typically work together in ways that hurt consumers and  investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>(and see <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/02/only-21-say-u-s-government-has-consent-of-the-governed-those-with-the-lowest-incomes-are-the-most-skeptical.html">this</a>).</p>
<p>Remember that the <a title="government helped and encouraged the giant banks" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/debunking-the-too-big-to-fail-myth.html">government helped and encouraged the giant banks</a> to get even bigger, and then has <a title="hidden their insolvency and s" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/its-not-the-great-recession-its-the-great-bank-robbery.html">hidden their insolvency and s</a><a title="hielded them from the free market, " href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/its-not-the-great-recession-its-the-great-bank-robbery.html">hielded them from the free market, </a> and helped them grow even during the severe downturn.</p>
<p>In return, the big banks and giant corporations have <a title="literally bought and paid" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/82-of-americans-clamp-down-on-wall.html">literally bought and paid</a> for the politicians.</p>
<p>Conservatives might call it “socialism” and liberals might call it “fascism” – <a title="they are the same thing economically" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/82-of-americans-clamp-down-on-wall.html">they are the same thing economically</a>.</p>
<p>But all Americans – conservatives and liberals alike – can agree that it is not capitalism, and it is not American.</p></blockquote>
<h3>PROSECUTE WALL STREET FRAUD!</h3>
<p>I <a title="pointed out" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/we-can-fix-america-if-we-focus-on-what-all-americans-liberals-and-conservatives-want.html">pointed out</a> a year ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Liberals tend to believe that the public should be  protected against harm, while conservatives tend to believe that people  should be left free to buy what they want.</p>
<p>Too far apart to ever agree?</p>
<p>No. Conservatives believe that people must be held responsible for  their actions and punished for their transgressions. Indeed, some <a title="82%" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35817048/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/" target="_blank">82%</a> of the American public wants tougher regulation of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Moreover, even for those who don’t like the government sticking its nose in our business, liberals and conservatives agree that if a  company chooses to make a representation about something, it can be  sued if it is a lie. In other words, all Americans agree that fraud laws  should be enforced against everyone from  the homeowner who fills out a mortgage application on a small house to  the head of a giant bank who makes false statements about the bank’s  balance sheets and the quality of it’s investments.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that financial scammers must be tried and put in prison.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Rasmussen <a title="found" href="http://www.kxlf.com/news/rasmussen-reports-survey-says-most-americans-oppose-government-bailouts/" target="_blank">found</a> last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two-out-of-three  Americans (66%) believe the federal government has not been aggressive  enough in pursuing possible criminal behavior by some Wall Street  bankers, but 10% don’t feel that’s true and 25% are not sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Economists <a title="agree" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/real-free-market-capitalists-demand-that-financial-fraud-be-prosecuted.html">agree</a>.</p>
<h3>END – OR AT LEAST REIN IN – THE FEDERAL RESERVE!</h3>
<p>As I <a title="pointed out" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/polls-americans-want-our-liberties-restored-our-troops-brought-home-and-the-federal-reserve-reined-in.html">pointed out</a> last month, Americans are not happy with the Federal Reserve:</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN <a title="notes" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/27/rep-ron-paul-the-country-is-ripe-for-revolution/" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are seeing a level of enthusiasm for Ron Paul that  can be compared with President Obama in 2008″, said Eric Brakey, Media  Coordinator for NYC Liberty HQ, the grassroots organization hosting the  rally for the candidate. “Congressman Paul’s youth support is different  now than it was during his last presidential campaign. It’s more  organized and it’s picking up steam and continues to grow”.</p>
<p>As the longtime congressman from Texas stepped onto the stage, the crowd screamed with enthusiasm. The audience’s biggest reaction came when he spoke about ending the Federal Reserve.  “The country has changed in the last four years, but my message hasn’t  changed” Paul said. “The country is ripe for a true revolution”.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least <a title="75% of the American people want a full audit of the Fed" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/december_2010/americans_still_strongly_favor_audit_of_the_fed" target="_blank">75% of the American people want a full audit of the Fed</a>, and <a title="most were against reconfirming Bernanke" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/november_2009/just_21_favor_bernanke_s_reappointment_as_fed_chairman" target="_blank">most were against reconfirming Bernanke</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Bloomberg <a title="noted" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/more-than-half-of-americans-want-fed-reined-in-or-abolished.html" target="_blank">noted</a> last December:</p>
<blockquote><p>A majority of Americans  are dissatisfied with the nation’s independent central bank, saying the  U.S. Federal Reserve should either be brought under tighter political  control or abolished outright, a poll shows.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Americans across the political spectrum say the Fed shouldn’t retain  its current structure of independence. Asked if the central bank should  be more accountable to Congress, left independent or abolished entirely,  39 percent said it should be held more accountable and 16 percent that  it should be abolished. Only 37 percent favor the status quo.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Economists <a title="agree" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/economists-occupy-and-end-the-fed.html">agree</a>.</p>
<h3>RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LIBERTY!</h3>
<p>As I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/polls-americans-want-our-liberties-restored-our-troops-brought-home-and-the-federal-reserve-reined-in.html">noted</a> in September, Americans want our freedom back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans have become much less tolerant of the wholesale  destruction of our constitutional freedoms in the name of fighting  terrorism.</p>
<p>As Talking Points Memo <a title="notes" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/pew-americans-disagree-that-wars-in-iraq-afghanistan-have-lessened-the-chance-of-another-terror-atta.php" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the eve of the ten year anniversary of 9/11, the Pew Research Center <a title="has released new data" href="http://people-press.org/files/legacy-questionnaires/Sept.%2011%20topline%20for%20release.pdf" target="_blank">has released new data</a> on Americans’ reaction to the attacks, and the foreign and national  security policies pursued in the post 9/11 era. They show a country with  views that have evolved on the relationship between civil liberties and  the tools given to government to fight terrorism, and a disbelief that  the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan helped to lessen the chance  there will be another terrorist attack on the United States.</p>
<p>The Pew survey showed a large shift in the number of Americans who  are willing to see some of their civil liberties go out the window in  the name of fighting terrorism. Directly after 9/11, Americans were  willing to make the deal, as 55 percent thought it was necessary,  against 35 percent who felt the opposite. Now, only 40 percent felt that giving up some civil liberties is necessary to curb terrorism, with 54 percent against.</p></blockquote>

<h3>END PERPETUAL WAR!</h3>
<p>Americans want to <a title="put a stop to perpetual warfare:" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/polls-americans-want-our-liberties-restored-our-troops-brought-home-and-the-federal-reserve-reined-in.html">put a stop to perpetual warfare:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Ron Paul is [partly] gaining popularity because he is  against the never-ending War On Terror, and wants to bring the troops  home. Americans are sick of the never-ending, ever-creeping war. See <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/03/poll-most-americans-strongly-oppose-u-s-intervention-in-arab-countries.html">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/15/134559832/poll-shows-64-percent-of-americans-saying-afghan-war-not-worth-it" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/09/iraq.poll/index.html" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>As Talking Points Memo <a title="reported" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/pew-americans-disagree-that-wars-in-iraq-afghanistan-have-lessened-the-chance-of-another-terror-atta.php" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier this month:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…Only about a quarter say the wars in Iraq (26%) and  Afghanistan (25%) have lessened the chances of terrorist attacks in the  United States,” the Pew report reads. “In both cases majorities say the  wars either have increased the risk of terrorism in this country or made  no difference.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Top American military leaders agree, saying that <a title="the war on terror has weakened our national security" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/four-stories-this-week-prove-that-the-war-on-terror-is-a-farce.html">the war on terror has weakened our national security</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>MAKE ELECTIONS FAIR!</h3>
<p>I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/we-can-fix-america-if-we-focus-on-what-all-americans-liberals-and-conservatives-want.html">noted</a> last year that Americans want fair elections:</p>
<blockquote><p>All Americans agree that … there should be free and fair  elections. That is why – according to ABC News and the Washington Post –  <a title="80 percent" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/17/citizens-united-poll-80-p_n_465396.html" target="_blank">80 percent</a> of all Americans oppose the Supreme Court’s recent decision allowing  unlimited campaign contributions. Americans understand that – unless we  take the flood of money out of elections – Washington will represent  special interests, and not us.</p>
<p>And we all agree on publicly verifiable, automatically audited paper  ballot elections with reasonable ID requirements, so that we assured  that no party can manipulate electronic voting results.</p></blockquote>
<h3>KEEP POISON OUT OF OUR FOOD AND WATER!</h3>
<p>I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/we-can-fix-america-if-we-focus-on-what-all-americans-liberals-and-conservatives-want.html">noted</a> last year that Americans want safe food and water:</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans want to be free to live our lives without being  poisoned. We agree on safe food, clean water and a healthy environment.</p>
<p>For example, polls show:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large majority of Americans want <a title="strong food safety rules" href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=54963" target="_blank">strong food safety rules</a>, and <a title="want genetically modified foods to be labeled" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567&amp;page=1" target="_blank">want genetically modified foods to be labeled</a></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE ON THESE CORE ISSUES, WHY AREN’T OUR DEMANDS BEING HEARD?</h3>
<p>If Americans from across the spectrum agree, why aren’t these desires being implemented by our politicians?</p>
<p>Because our politicians are <a title="bought and paid for … lock, stock and barrel" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/well-theres-your-problem-right-there-insider-trading-rules-don%E2%80%99t-apply-to-congress.html">bought and paid for … lock, stock and barrel</a>.</p>
<p>And the powers-that-be are good at using the <a title="age-old divide and conquer" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/the-founding-fathers-tried-to-warn-us-about-the-threat-from-a-two-party-system.html">age-old divide and conquer</a> trick to keep us weak, divided and fighting at each others’ throat … instead of for what we actually want.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the main reason that we are impotent is that we don’t realize that the overwhelming majority of Americans want the same things we do.</p>
<p>Indeed, most Americans – conservatives and liberals – are <strong><em><a title="fed up" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/2010/09/poll-after-poll-shows-that-both.html">fed up</a></em></strong> with <em>both</em> the mainstream Republican <em>and</em> Democratic parties. This is not surprising, given that neither party is  addressing the core demands of the American people as a whole.</p>
<p>Sure, liberals and conservatives will always disagree on some things.  But if we realized how many core beliefs we share, we would <a title="unite to take our country back" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/the-big-banks-have-sold-us-out-democrats-and-republicans-have-sold-us-out-no-one-is-defending-our-interests-our-future-is-going-up-in-flames-it%E2%80%99s-time-for-us-to-stand-up-and-defend-ourselv.html">unite to take our country back</a> from those who disagree with fundamental American values.</p>
