<div class="content">It's different in Vancouver says a reader in response to <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2011/11/vancouver-real-estate-bubble-in.html" target="_blank">Vancouver Real Estate Bubble in Pictures; Presenting the $1,050,000 "Livable" House </a>.<br />
<br />
"<i>Fortunate Fool</i>" writes ...<br />
<blockquote>Hello Mish<br />
<br />
Vancouver is a different world. To truly appreciate it, let me give you an example. In a normal world, if you had bought a house in April 2004 for $6 million, how much would you put it for sale today? Hard to say right? Let say your house value increased with an inflation at 2% per year, that would be roughly $6.9 million. In the current economic situation, you would be happy to get that money back. <br />
<br />
In Vancouver, it's different. If you bought at that price in 2004, you would put it back on the market in 2010 for... $17.9 million! A compounded return of 20% a year. But there is a problem, it turns out that you couldn't sell the property. So in that case, what would you do? You would decrease the price, right? <br />
<br />
Wrong! Remember, you are in Vancouver, and it's different there. No, you would put the property back on the market for... $31.9 million! (a 78% increase from last year's price or an expected annual compounded rate of return of 27%).<br />
<br />
Repeat after me. No, Vancouver is not in a bubble. </blockquote>Fortunate Fool backs up his claim with this article from the Vancouver Sun: <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/Vancouver+mansion+sale+million/5735598/story.html#ixzz1eD1sryZs" target="_blank">Vancouver mansion for sale: $31.9 million</a><br />
<blockquote>A house has just gone on the market at 3390 The Crescent in Shaughnessy for $31.9 million. That may sound like a lot of money, but it isn’t the highest listing price in Metro Vancouver — a house at 2190 Camelot in West Vancouver is for sale at $39.9 million. And has been, for several months.<br />
<br />
High-end homes like this often take a while to sell, because once you get into the tens of millions, there aren’t many buyers. In fact, the $31.9-million Shaughnessy home was for sale last year for $17.9 million, but didn’t sell.<br />
<br />
Property records list the owners as K. Fan Hiu and H.F. Chi, who purchased the home in April 2004 for $6 million. Ted Wang of Royal Pacific Realty said the couple have decided to downsize to an apartment.<br />
<br />
Wang said the owners decided to raise the listing price after looking at the high prices mansions are commanding in Shaughnessy. He noted that a house he sold last year on Angus Drive for $5.7 million was recently assessed at $9 million.</blockquote><b>It's Different in Bizarro World</b><br />
<br />
The owners upped their price from $17.9 million (offered just last year) to $31.9 million, an increase of 78%, because they want to "<i>downsize to an apartment</i>".<br />
<br />
This of course makes perfect sense because "<i>It's different in Bizarro World</i>" just as it is in Vancouver.<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds may be interested in the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World" target="_blank">Complete History of Bizarro World</a>" from Superman to Seinfeld to Saturday Night Live.<br />
<br />
We can safely add Vancouver to the list.<br />
