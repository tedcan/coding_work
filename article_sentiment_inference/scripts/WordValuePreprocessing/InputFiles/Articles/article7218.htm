<p>Planning to give hot-ticket electronics gifts this year? You can shop smart by following a couple of steps you may not have considered yet, such as making your purchases at highly rated retailers, and trying your hand at haggling. </p>

<p><strong>Buy online:</strong> In our <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/december/electronics-computers/where-to-buy-electronics/overview/index.htm" target="_blank">report on where to buy electronics</a>, Amazon.com, BHPhotoVideo.com, Crutchfield.com, and Newegg.com all received strong marks from readers who responded to our electronics retailer survey. Those four were also standouts for shipping and home delivery. </p>

<p>Overall, online merchants did better than walk-in retailers, even for big-ticket items like TVs. For walk-in stores, independent retailers topped our <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/december/electronics-computers/where-to-buy-electronics/ratings/index.htm" target="_blank">Ratings</a> (available to subscribers). The Apple Store, Costco, and Staples also got high scores.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/december/electronics-computers/computers/overview/index.htm" target="_blank">separate survey of computer buyers</a> found more overall satisfaction with online vendors than with walk-in stores (<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/december/electronics-computers/computers/where-to-buy-computers-ratings/index.htm" target="_blank">Ratings</a> available to subscribers.) Just 2 percent of computer shoppers who dealt with online retailers said they paid more than expected, but more than half of walk-in buyers spent more than expected. Highest-rated walk-in stores for computers were the Apple Store, Micro Center, and Costco.</p>

<p>Newegg.com was the only retailer in our electronics-shopping survey to receive top marks for price. Crutchfield.com stood alone among online retailers for having top-of-the-line customer service.</p>

<p><strong>Haggle:</strong> Just 13 percent of shoppers said they tried haggling at walk-in stores. But those who did saved an average of $82. Shoppers saved a median of $105 on televisions, $53 on digital cameras, and $43 on DVD/Blu-ray players. </p>

<p>Four in five hagglers negotiated the price of their purchases at HHGregg, P.C. Richard & Son, and independent walk-in stores. At Best Buy and Sears, at least three in five hagglers shaved dollars off the prices they paid. Hagglers for computers were successful more than half the time; the average savings was a whopping $103.</p>

<p>You can also haggle for a discount online. Our survey found that nearly three of five were successful in scoring a price break, even though few even think to try in the first place. A third of them negotiated with a retailer by phone vs. 29 percent through e-mail messages and 13 percent by online chat. Two-thirds of computer buyers who negotiated directly with manufacturers got a lower price.</p>
