<p>The Federal Communications Commission is seeking to hold a hearing on AT&T's plan to purchase T-Mobile, saying that the proposed merger of the wireless giant and smaller carrier would diminish competition, and is not in the public's interest.   </p>

<p>FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has reportedly filed an order requesting that the other four commissioners vote to have an administrative law judge hear the case, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier today. </p>

<p>This past summer, the <a href="http://news.consumerreports.org/electronics/2011/08/regulators-block-attt-mobile-merger.html" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Justice filed its own suit</a> to block AT&T's proposed $39 billion deal to acquire T-Mobile. The FCC's hearing would occur after the DOJ's pending lawsuit is settled, and would only go forward if the proposed merger is not blocked by that current suit. The DOJ trial is set to begin in 2012. </p>

<p>In a statement to our sister site, The Consumerist, Larry Solomon, AT&T's senior vice president of Corporate Communications wrote: "The FCC's action today is disappointing. It is yet another example of a government agency acting to prevent billions in new investment and the creation of many thousands of new jobs at a time when the US economy desperately needs both."</p>

<p>Parul Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports said in a statement:  </p>

<blockquote>We believe it is critical for the FCC to examine the consequences of a combined AT&T/T-Mobile, including higher prices, fewer choices, and the negative impact on competition in the wireless market -- all which make it clear that this merger is simply not in the public&#8217;s best interest.</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://news.consumerreports.org/electronics/2011/04/cr-analysis-t-mobile-is-cheaper-than-att.html?EXTKEY=I91CONL&CMP=OTC-Consumeristlinks" target="_blank">our analysis of the voice and data plans available from AT&T and T-Mobile</a>, T-Mobile wireless plans typically cost $15-$50 per month less than comparable plans from AT&T. </p>

<p>The last time the FCC proposed such a hearing was in 2002, to address the proposed merger of EchoStar and DirecTV. That merger failed. </p>
