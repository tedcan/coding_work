<div class="content"><p>THE high fees that private-equity firms charged in the boom, typically 2% of the assets they oversee (the “management” fee) and 20% of the upside (the “performance” fee), are harder to pocket now. Investors have been bearing down on these fees for the past two years. Even big firms are reportedly caving in, particularly for those writing large cheques.But one type of fee has bucked the trend. A new study by Dechert, a law firm, and Preqin, a research outfit, finds that “deal” fees, which portfolio companies have to pay to private-equity firms for various services, actually rose in 2009-10, in spite of all the hullabaloo around lower charges. Transaction fees, which buy-out firms charge firms when they buy them (and yes, you did read that right), went up by at least 25% on average for 2009-10 deals that were $500m or larger, compared with deals done between 2005 and 2008. Deals between $500m and $1 billion, for example, had an average transaction fee of 1.24% of the deal amount in 2009-10, compared with 0.99% in 2005-08. “Monitoring” fees, which portfolio companies pay their private-equity owners each year for advisory services, also went up.Deal fees essentially enable buy-out firms to get paid twice to do their job—first by investors and then by their portfolio companies.
