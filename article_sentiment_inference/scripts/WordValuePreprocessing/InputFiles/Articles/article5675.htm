<div class="content">AS A child, Babbage struggled to master the well-formed curlicues and prim horizontal strokes of cursive handwriting. He never quite got the hang of it, only to be rescued by the digital age. Now, though, researchers led by Jeff Yan, of Newcastle University, have found that loops and crosses may prove critical online, too. In a paper co-authored with two colleagues he shows how these caligraphic fripperies can unlock the visual puzzle dubbed the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, but better known as CAPTCHAs.  The term CAPTCHA was coined in 2000 by Luis van Ahn and his fellow academics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The idea was to stop spammers (and later criminals) creating accounts through which they could join forums and send e-mail by imposing a hurdle that would be tough for computers, but easy for human beings to scale. (This newspaper discussed the squiggles and potential future replacements in depth in 2009.)  Dr Yan's group looked at a popular CAPTCHA technique known as "crowding characters together" (CCT) in which letters simply overlap. CCTs were considered a hard computer science problem, and no algorithm had yet been capable of disentagling the twists and skews of layered text, whereas the human visual cortex performs the task swiftly. The team's method can pick out the ...</div>
