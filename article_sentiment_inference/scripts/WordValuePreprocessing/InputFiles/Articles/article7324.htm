<div class="content"><p>(And no, the answer is <em>not</em> to give $50/week allowance to a six year old!)</p>
<p>Last week our minivan’s transmission bit the dust.  (Thankfully it bit the dust in our driveway.)  Over the next couple of days my wife and I discussed what to do: whether to fix our car, whether to buy a new-to-us one — buying a new car didn’t enter the picture! — which kind to buy, and how to pay for it.</p>
<p>We had a very level-headed discussion about the whole matter.  I’m glad that <a href="http://www.mightybargainhunter.com/2009/02/02/7-money-lessons-learned-during-7-years-of-marriage/">we’ve learned a thing or two</a> now that we’re approaching our tenth anniversary.  At some points in the discussion, when it was getting serious and when we were trying to make sure that we understood each other, our daughter came in to ask this or that, and at first we asked her to let us finish the discussion privately.</p>
<p>After we got through that part of the conversation, we called her in to let her know that nothing was wrong and that we needed to think carefully about what to do because it was a lot of money.</p>
<p>At some point, either my wife or I made the observation that this topic really wasn’t over her head, or something that we needed to shield her from.  We really didn’t have to discuss the financial questions of getting a car privately.</p>
<p><strong>So after that point, we involved our daughter in buying the car.</strong>  My wife took her to CarMax and she got to ride in the cars, and tell her which one she liked better and why.  But probably the more important part was that she learned that we were going to borrow money to get the car.  We explained that we were going to ask our credit union to lend us money to buy the car, and that we had to pay it back or else they’d be able to take the car, because we didn’t really own the car until the loan was paid back.</p>
<p>Then tonight my daughter asked me, “Daddy, why are you getting a loan for the car?”  Music to my ears — not necessarily <em>because</em> we’re borrowing, but because this is the most advanced money question my daughter has asked about to date.  I got to explain some things about investments to her.  I explained that we could sell some of our investments to pay for the car, but at this time we didn’t want to.  I got to explain the concept of interest to her, and that it wasn’t free to borrow money.  I also got to explain the concept of creditworthiness to her; because Mommy and Daddy pay their bills on time, the bank didn’t charge us much interest on the loan.  (We got approved for a <em>very</em> good rate on our used car loan.)</p>
<p>It was great to see her asking questions about personal finance.  <strong>I think the trick was not to hide the family’s personal finance from her.</strong>
