It takes the form of a lengthy series of exchanges between two old friends: Lilia Shevtsova, a Russian who works for America\xe2\x80\x99s Carnegie Endowment in Moscow, and Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador there. Their subject is the relationship between Russia and the West, still neurotic and plagued with misunderstandings 20 years after the Soviet collapse. Why do so many Russians feel threatened, betrayed and disappointed by the West? Some there see it as a flawed paradigm of human rights, free elections and the rule of law. Others find it a self-righteous bully.Ms Shevtsova politely bemoans a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure of imagination\xe2\x80\x9d in the West.

The speech deals with "the flaw" that so confounded Alan Greenspan, how private sector investors failed to control risks in the banking sector. The problem was not that bank executives had no skin in the game; in 2006, the managers with the largest bank stakes were Dick Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Jimmy Cayne at Bear Stearns, Stan O\'Neal at Merrill Lynch, John Mack at Morgan Stanley and Angelo Mozilo at Countywide. All lost substantial chunks of their wealth as share prices collapsed.  The fundamental problem is that tax rules (the deductibility of interest) and regulations encouraged banks to gear up their balance sheets. Effective control of the banks, however, rested with the shareholders. As Haldane puts it    Ownership and control rights are vested in agents comprising less than 5% of the balance sheet.  Thanks to limited liability, the losses of these shareholders are also constrained. In the early 19th century, liability was unlimited, prompting banks to run with much more conservative balance sheets.

As the capital of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s long-gone cotton trade, the city is particularly well-endowed with 19th-century civic grandeur; but all over the country, the juxtaposition of the splendour of the old buildings with the impotence of modern councils speaks eloquently of the decline of local government in Britain.Now the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government wants to shift power to locally elected mayors. The aim is a worthy one, and the only thing wrong with the plans is that they do not go nearly far enough.For more than a century governments have sucked power away from Britain\xe2\x80\x99s cities. These days most mayors have little more than a gold chain to show for their offices, and local government is kept on a short financial leash by Whitehall, which provides most of the money that it spends, thus undermining its power and its responsibility.The previous Labour government went some way towards reversing that trend by encouraging a few cities, including London, to vote for mayors...    \r\n')

Don't get me wrong, after 25 years of being a market technician, I would never be so  arrogant to think I could master Mr. Market.  We told members to get long Sunday October 2nd at 1090 and told everyone who would listen to scale out of the market on the way to our 1275 target.  We have been telling investors to wait for a retracement to 1188 before getting long again.  As the market waits and hopes for a Holiday rally, I see less of a probability for my original year-end target of 1350. However, we will have an opportunity to get long before year-end for a move higher.    Last Friday, we wrote to our Forbes readers that a short term risk was The Super Committees failure to reach any resolution on cuts in the deficit.  We told readers we would be a buyer on that pull back.  Yesterday, we decided to get long Gold instead of the S&P.  Even though we have seen a high correlation between equities and gold recently because of deflationary fears, we think long term Gold will act as a reserve currency opposed to paper based currencies.

This is one of those rare times.      Please consider  China vice premier sees chronic global recession      A long-term global recession is certain to happen and China must focus on domestic problems, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan has said.      "The one thing that we can be certain of, among all the uncertainties, is that the global economic recession caused by the international financial crisis will be chronic," Wang was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying at the weekend.      Wang\'s comments were the most bearish forecast ever by a top Chinese decision-maker about the world economy, and Beijing\'s worry about a worsening global environment could translate into an impetus for pro-growth policies at home.   Why this Astonishing Admission?       Regular Mish readers will not find that forecast surprising in the least. What is surprising is the high-ranking official who makes that forecast.      In a world of global economic denial about the Euro, about deficits in the US, about housing bubbles in Australia, China, and Canada, and in general denial about every economic woe the world faces, one might ask "why this astonishing admission?"      I have a 3-part answer         As China shifts from an untenable infrastructure model to a consumption  model, as Europe faces a Eurozone breakup and harsh recession, as the US  faces a deficit crisis (albeit halfheartedly at best),  much global  pain is in order.      By framing the problem as a global problem, the vice-premier gets to blame the world economy for the internal strife in China.       This is an indication that China is falling apart right here, right now, much faster than the Western world believes.        The admission by the vice-premier simply reflects the demise of China\'s export model in the face of a rapidly slowing global economy accompanied by a regime change in China that will be forced to shift its internal priorities.      These thoughts echo comments I have made previously in ...

In recent months Gold has had a high correlation between equities.  Gold is know longer an inflationary trade as deflation is now an issue.  However, we think long term Gold will act as a reserve currency opposed to paper based currencies driving prices higher.  We have not hit the max point of pain in the equity markets and look for more draw down before getting long.  Currently, the Vix is only trading $33.98, respectively, the Vix spiked above $45 in October when the S&P 500 broke 1,100.  Risk is not pricing in a panic point yet, be patient, there is no rush to jump in.    As we wrote yesterday, the last several months we have been on target with our calls and in a zone.  Don't get me wrong, after 25 years of being a market technician, I would never be so  arrogant to think I could master Mr. Market.  We told members to get long Sunday October 2nd at 1090 and told everyone who would listen to scale out of the market on the way to our 1275 target.  We have been telling investors to wait for a retracement to 1188 before getting long again.  As the market waits and hopes for a Holiday rally, I see less of a probability for my original year-end target of 1350. However, we will have an opportunity to get long before year-end for a move higher.    Last Friday, we wrote to our Forbes readers that a short term risk was The Super Committees failure to reach any resolution on cuts in the deficit.  We told readers we would be a buyer on that pull back.  Yesterday, we decided to get long Gold instead of the S&P.   Additionally, last week we recommended to our member to start shorting Crude Oil at the $99 to $100 price level.    Look for relative value trades right now, go long utilities & health Care and remain short financials.

Currently, the Vix is only trading $33.98, respectively, the Vix spiked above $45 in October when the S&P 500 broke 1,100.  Risk is not pricing in a panic point yet, be patient, there is no rush to jump in.    As we wrote yesterday, the last several months we have been on target with our calls and in a zone.  Don't get me wrong, after 25 years of being a market technician, I would never be so  arrogant to think I could master Mr. Market.  We told members to get long Sunday October 2nd at 1090 and told everyone who would listen to scale out of the market on the way to our 1275 target.  We have been telling investors to wait for a retracement to 1188 before getting long again.  As the market waits and hopes for a Holiday rally, I see less of a probability for my original year-end target of 1350. However, we will have an opportunity to get long before year-end for a move higher.    Last Friday, we wrote to our Forbes readers that a short term risk was The Super Committees failure to reach any resolution on cuts in the deficit.  We told readers we would be a buyer on that pull back.  Yesterday, we decided to get long Gold instead of the S&P.   Additionally, last week we recommended to our member to start shorting Crude Oil at the $99 to $100 price level.    Look for relative value trades right now, go long utilities & health Care and remain short financials.    The chart below is from our Friday's article, it still relevant with the current market conditions.

The rating carries a negative outlook, which means a further cut is possible. "The country\'s large fiscal imbalances, high indebtedness across all sectors, and adverse macroeconomic outlook mean the sovereign\'s credit profile is no longer consistent with an investment-grade rating," Fitch said in a news release. The ratings firm said recession will make the government\'s deficit-cutting plan more challenging and will hurt bank asset quality, but that the government\'s commitment to the plan was "strong." The Portugal PSI 20 index is up 0.2% to 5,241.26, underperforming other European stock markets.  Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Nonetheless, the view is particularly prevalent among American military alumni of Anbar, the province in Iraq that descended into hell when (foreign) al-Qaeda insurgents overran it. In 2006 Iraqi civilians took a stand against the insurgents and ran them out of town.During the past year or so Taliban insurgents appear to have taken ever less care to protect civilians.

So how do the costs of sustaining the euro compare with the costs of its falling apart?The question does not have a simple answer. For a start, there are lots of different ways to fall apart: a wholesale dissolution into the original currencies; a fissioning into northern hard-currency and southern soft-currency blocks; or the exit of a trickle of countries, or just one. Further complexities come from the panoply of choices the departing and remaining states would make after the fall.

A few large corporations prescient enough to have their own banking licences are depositing their cash directly with the European Central Bank rather than entrusting it to banks. An obvious step to douse the flames would be to recapitalise European banks. Yet by how much and with what capital?  Global regulations are already forcing banks to plump up their cushions significantly. Nomura reckons that simply getting banks to comply with the new Basel 3 rules, plus an additional surcharge on globally important banks, could leave European lenders, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s included, needing to raise more than \xe2\x82\xac100 billion ...   \r\n')

But as the chart below suggests, the recent relationship between China\'s currency and America\'s trade deficit with China is not what China hawks in the Senate think it is.

There are many things American companies dislike about the way business is done in China: intellectual-property theft, the impossibility of winning government contracts, baffling rules on corporate ownership and so on. However the place for fixing these things is the World Trade Organisation, not Congress. President Obama\'s administration has already passed on two opportunities to label China a currency manipulator, out of a well-founded fear of sparking a trade war.

It matters that voters should believe this. Not because the claim  will soothe those suffering most from spending cuts or lost employment.  Instead, a sense of fairness is vital to the broad mass of voters who  keep their jobs in even nasty recessions, and whose households will  survive this crisis. Fairness gives the majority permission to support  policies needed to fix the mess, but which will impose real pain on  some.That is why it spelled danger for the government when new figures  were released on November 16th, showing that youth unemployment had  crossed the one million mark: its highest level in a generation. Several  caveats surround that number. Youth unemployment has been rising in  Britain since before the credit crunch.

Britain\xe2\x80\x99s youth unemployment rate is 21.9%\xe2\x80\x94far below  countries like Spain.

Like America, Europe has vast beds of shale rock, in which innumerable bubbles of natural gas are trapped. By cannoning water, sand and chemicals at them, a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or \xe2\x80\x9cfracking\xe2\x80\x9d, the bubbles can be released. This, the firms said, could bring Europe the same bonanza of cheap gas and new jobs in the industry that America is now enjoying (see article).

His singular vision shaped the products Apple has conjured up, especially over the last 14 years, after Jobs returned to the helm of the company he had founded. Jobs's death in October resembled the passing of a major religious figure. But all of his technological miracles, along with a billion others sold by Apple's competitors, would be merely pretty receptacles were it not for Dennis Ritchie. It is to him that they owe their digital souls, the operating systems and programs which make them tick. In the early 1970s Mr Ritchie invented the C programming language. It fundamentally changed how software programs are created. Its popularity stemmed from a mix of robustness and efficiency. Crucially, it was thin. In geek-speak that means it used little computing power at a time when that was in short supply while allowing programmers to control hardware directly with little effort. It was also portable. A C program written for one computer could be modified to work on another. (This is not always easy, but it is possible.) If that were not world-changing enough, Mr Ritchie was also instrumental (with Ken Thompson and others) in developing Unix, an operating system project begun in 1969 that was originally intended to be a ...   \r\n")

So the Central Bank surprised everyone in August when it cut its benchmark rate by half a point (to 12%) even though inflation was then at 6.9%. On October 19th, the bank did the same again. So is the government of President Dilma Rousseff, in office since January, giving priority to other goals, such as sustaining growth and preventing the overvaluation of the currency, rather than keeping inflation low? And has the Central Bank lost its independence?No, say officials, who cite two sets of reasons for the rate cuts.

That gap may reflect the impact of ECB buying (the bank only buys in the secondary market). The sharp rise in yields may reflect the bad economic news (Spain's GDP stagnated in the third quarter and is now expected to grow just 0.8% next year) but it may also reflect uncertainty ahead of Sunday's election, given that the likely PM, Mariano Rajoy, has been rather vague about his programme.You might think that high yields in the peripheral euro zone countries would attract bargain hunters but it doesn't seem to be the case. Cesar Perez of JP Morgan Private bank (himself a Spaniard) gave me a clue earlier this week; fund managers he talked to were unwilling to buy peripheral bonds of yields or 7-8% but they would buy at 4-5% The reason for this paradox is that, at yields of 7-8%, the finances of Spain and Italy look unsustainable (the same would be true of most developed countries). A fall in yields to 4-5% would, in contrast, be a sign that the crisis was over and an indication that both countries could get their fiscal houses in order.   \r\n")

After years leading the league tables on cannabis use, England and Wales fell below the EU average in 2010 for the first time. People aged between 15 and 34 no longer hold the big-country record for amphetamine use. The rate of drug-induced deaths remains high in a country where drug use is relatively widespread, but at least it has fallen.Domestic studies confirm this picture. As the chart shows, the proportion of young people who have used cannabis in the past year continues to decline from a peak in 1998, according to the British Crime Survey (BCS). Use of class A drugs such as cocaine and heroin has not declined as much, but prior-year use of powder cocaine fell by a third in the two years from 2008-09. Figures from the National Treatment Agency suggest that heroin and crack cocaine are mostly confined to an ageing cohort.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough job\xe2\x80\xa6    The culpable email in question, offering discounted cosmetic surgery, including breast enlargement, has been banned by the ASA for \xe2\x80\x9cpressuring\xe2\x80\x9d consumers into hurriedly making potentially life-changing decisions in just a few hours. The terms of the deal, as for many Groupons, offered offered discounts of well over 50% on operations at a clinic in Manchester if customers booked before midnight on the day the deal was sent out. The deal was sent out in May with surgery to take place by 28 November.    The ASA acted after receiving a complaint from a member of the public and on from the Independent Healthcare Advisory Service, claiming the Groupon deal was irresponsible \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it encouraged recipients to hurry into a decision to purchase cosmetic surgery\xe2\x80\x9d.    The ASA pointed out that the marketing and ethical code run by the appropriately monikered British Association for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) prohibited ads that offered discounts linked to a deadline date for booking appointments \xe2\x80\x9cor other date-linked incentives\xe2\x80\x9d. The practice also goes against the good practice guide of the General Medical Council.    The ASA went on to say that the \xe2\x80\x9cvery limited time in which consumers had to buy the voucher pressured consumers into making a decision to (to all intents and purposes) purchase cosmetic surgery\xe2\x80\x9d.    \xe2\x80\x9cWe considered that the decision to undergo physically invasive procedures was one that required substantial consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ASA. \xe2\x80\x9cWe noted consumers only had 24 hours in which to buy the voucher and because of that, we considered that consumers buying the voucher would have already financially and mentally committed themselves to going ahead with a procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d    This is not the first time Groupon have been in the news this week. A poor baker in Reading offered a deal to sell cupcakes for \xc2\xa36.50 a box, generating a loss of \xc2\xa32.50 per box. She was inundated with over 8,500 orders, which then wiped out her profits for the year. Of course, no-one made her offer the deal, but she still feels aggrieved that her marketing worked so well.    But leaving cakes aside and going back to the baps, the ASA concluded that the plastic surgery email promotion was irresponsible and banned the ad a mere six months after it had been and gone. The ASA also banned a similar type of ad, one that referred to an \xe2\x80\x98easy\xe2\x80\x99 way to bigger breasts commissioned by the Harley Medical Centre back \xc2\xa0in 2007. The advertiser commented that many women felt \xe2\x80\x9crenewed confidence and self-esteem after cosmetic enhancement\xe2\x80\x9d and that there was not any implication that only big breasts could make someone happy. We beg to differ\xe2\x80\xa6    *allegedly       \r\n')

Doubts have long persisted about the safety of these machines, which emit a minute amount of radiation, and the EU has explicitly linked such doubts to its decision, announced at the start of the week. As the press release has it:In order not to risk jeopardising citizens' health and safety, only  security scanners which do not use X-ray technology are added to the  list of authorised methods for passenger screening at EU airports.That's not exactly going to cheer up American travellers, who are already struggling to understand why the Transportation Security Administration decided that the X-ray scanners were suitable for them to use. Another kind of body-scanner is available, which uses radiofrequency technology that   has not been linked to cancer scares. These are installed in some American airports, such as Atlanta and Dallas, and will be the scanner of choice in Europe.Siim Kallas, the EU transport commissioner, explained some of the reasoning behind the decision:Security scanners are not a panacea but they do offer a real possibility to reinforce passenger security.  Security scanners are a valuable alternative to existing screening methods and are  very efficient in detecting both metallic and non-metallic objects.

guest article by Emily Guy Birken, author of  The SAHMambulust . In this article, she offers suggestions for cutting the costs associated with car ownership.     Owning a car is an expensive proposition, but most of us never stop to consider the cost of each trip. Unless you live in a city with great public transportation, you use a car for everything. We jump into our cars to commute, run errands, visit friends, go shopping or even just take in the fall foliage.  Be proactive  about your car to keep your ownership costs low.     Here are five ways to make sure that your car remains a manageable expense, rather than a financial black hole.    Don\xe2\x80\x99t cheap out on a mechanic.    When you find a reputable mechanic whom you trust, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see bargain basement bills.  Mechanics not only have to stay on top of the ever-changing trends of car engines, but they also need to make sure their (very expensive) tools keep up with cars\xe2\x80\x99 needs and are well maintained.  A knowledgeable mechanic is worth the extra money.  One who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he is doing but will save you a couple of bucks can often cause expensive harm to your car.  This is not the place to try to save.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll spend less in the long run if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to pay a great mechanic.    Looking for the cheapest mechanic will cost you more money in future repairs, so don\xe2\x80\x99t be  penny wise, pound foolish . Think about the larger picture.    Make smart gas choices.    There may be a great deal of hype about premium fuel options, but most daily drivers are just fine with the lowest octane gas at the pump.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure about your car\xe2\x80\x99s gas needs, check your owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual.  Even if the recommendation is for the premium grade of fuel, chances are that you would only need to fork over for the high-grade stuff in warm weather, when hauling extra weight, or driving on extremely steep mountain roads.  Any other times, save yourself the money.  And if you\xe2\x80\x99re still not sure what your car needs, talk to your mechanic or check the internet message boards devoted to your make and model\xe2\x80\x94there are plenty of them!    Watch the advertised prices as the station. You may  pay more for your gas if you use a credit card , because many stations now charge gas customers different prices depending on whether they use cash or a credit card. You may be able to make up some of the difference with a  gas rewards credit card , but again, make sure the price you pay above the cash price is worth the benefits.    Provided you pay off your credit card each month, this could be a savvy way to reduce your fuel bill each month and keep you motoring for less, as long as you make smart choices.    Take good care of your tires.    Tires are one of the costliest items that you will have to replace during the life of the car.  While they are not made to last forever, you can ensure you get your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of each set by practicing good maintenance.  Keeping the tires properly inflated will not only make sure they last but will also save you on fuel efficiency.  Check your tires monthly for underinflation and wear.    Keep your car clean.    If you live in an area with long, cold winters, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably surrounded by cars that are rusting away.  Cars that are exposed to salt will succumb to rust, which can shorten the lifespan of the vehicle.  Especially in winter, you want to make sure that your car is regularly cleaned and waxed to keep the metal safe from the eroding properties of salt.    Similarly, if you notice a chip of paint missing from your body, touch it up!  That spot is open to the elements and salt and will eventually rust over.    Don\xe2\x80\x99t ignore little problems.    A friend\xe2\x80\x99s car was revving but not catching when he turned the ignition.  When he tried again, the car started and he went along his way.  The problem?  He was short on transmission fluid. Had he not topped off that fluid, he could have destroyed his transmission and been looking at a multi-thousand dollar repair bill, plus an out-of-commission car. Because he took care of the problem quickly, he paid just a few dollars for transmission fluid instead of using his maintenance budget for the year in one shot. We can become so used to the idea that we just jump in the car that we can sometimes end up ignoring small warning signs.  If your car is behaving oddly, get it to a trusted mechanic quickly.  Always pay attention to small issues.     Maintaining your car is an investment  that will keep you motoring for years after your less-savvy neighbors and friends have had to replace their vehicles and spent unnecessary costs.

Within a fixed currency they cannot devalue. Instead they need a combination of lower real wages, lower input prices and higher productivity. Higher inflation in Germany would make that easier. Structural reforms are hard, otherwise governments would have undertaken them long ago. But if countries continue to avoid hard choices, the adjustment will eventually be forced on them through recession and unemployment.At the same time these economies must work off their debts. For the public sector, that can be through a combination of tax increases, spending cuts or growth. But it is hard, not least because Western societies have started ageing, which means that fewer people are in work paying tax and more in retirement claiming benefits.

To avoid making a string of bad decisions you'll regret when the credit card bills come in, you'll need careful planning and self-discipline.       The Jenny Pincher  offers some pointers that will keep you from losing it in the holiday hysteria:       * Map out a budget.  Put pen to paper -- or mouse to spreadsheet -- and develop a maximum spending level for everyone you feel obligated to give a gift. Ideally, your budget will present a worst-case financial scenario.       * Scout deals online before braving the mall.  There's no way to tell whether or not a deal at a store is good unless you have something to compare it to. Find the lowest prices for the stuff you're targeting online before heading out into the real world to see if you can beat those prices.       * Use your smartphone on the go.  If you stumble upon an item you didn't realize you needed to buy, pre-planning won't help you. That's when you pull out a smartphone to compare prices before you commit.

But now retailers are beating those shopping sites at their own game by posting sales on Facebook and Twitter. So far we&#8217;ve seen bargains on coffeemakers and other small appliances but some of the prices are so low we wonder if you&#8217;re getting a good deal or a raw deal.      In our survey of  16,000 Consumer Reports subscribers  who made recent appliance purchases,  Amazon.com  and  Abt Electronics , which also ships nationwide, were judged best for price, selection and all-around experience. Our subscribers also liked  QVC  for small appliances as well as their local independent dealers. We can&#8217;t vouch for all the appliances you&#8217;ll see on sale but here are some of Consumer Reports recent Best Buys. Use the Price & Shop feature on our Ratings charts to compare prices at a number of different retailers.        Coffeemakers     At prices ranging from $35 to $53, the  Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT  is a CR Best Buy. The brew performance of the 8- to 14-cup model was excellent and convenience and carafe handling was very good. When not on sale, the 12 drip coffeemakers on Consumer Reports recommended list range in price from $40 to $130. Pod coffeemakers typically cost a bit more with recommended models priced from $130 to $150.        Mixers     The  KitchenAid Classic  stand mixer is a perennial favorite and a CR Best Buy. We&#8217;ve seen prices ranging from $179 ( Lowes.com ) to $270. In Consumer Reports tests it was aces at whipping, mixing and kneading but our testers found it a bit noisy. The  Hamilton Beach Eclectrics  stand mixer we tested is also a CR Best Buy and ranges in price from $150 to $252. It didn&#8217;t knead as well as the KitchenAid but it was quieter. If you don&#8217;t want to spend three figures for a gift, the two CR Best Buy hand mixers can be had for less than $40.        Toasters and toaster ovens     At about $35, the  Hamilton Beach Digital 22502  two-slice toaster, a CR Best Buy, wasn&#8217;t the greatest thing since sliced bread but it toasted evenly and was a cinch to use. If you have more counter space, you might want to opt for a four-slice toaster or even a toaster oven. The  Cuisinart CPT-190  toaster, which ranges in price from $85 to $100, earned a CR Best Buy as did the  Oster TSSTTVMNDG  toaster oven, which at $75 to $97 was a bargain too. In addition to making good toast, it was very good at baking and broiling.        Cookware     Consumer Reports recommends 13 different sets of cookware that range in price from $160 to $540. But our CR Best Buy, the non-stick  EarthPan with Sand Flow , can be found for as little as $130 at both  Amazon.com  and  Walmart.com , according to our Price & Shop results. The 10-piece set cooked evenly, had sturdy handles and was easy to clean. If you prefer your cookware uncoated, the three sets we recommend range in price from $400 to $540.        Knives     The CR Best Buy of our knife sets was a  Ginsu Chikara , an eight-piece forged set that can be found online for as little as $60. Our testers said the knives were champs at cutting and the handles were comfortable. Consumer Reports also tested some knives endorsed by celebrity cooks Paula Deen and Rachel Ray but found they didn\'t make the cut.        Blenders     The  Ninja Master Prep Professional QB1004  blender was a whiz at crushing ice and making icy drinks and held up well after multiple ice-smashing sessions. You can find it online for $50 or less. Of the 11 blenders we recommend, it&#8217;s the least expensive. Compare that to the  Vita-Mix 5200 , which performs similarly but typically sells for $450. It&#8217;s one of our recommended models. We also recommended three immersion blenders, the CR Best Buy is the  Miallegro Professional MiTutto 9090 , which sells for $50 and includes several attachments.        Vacuum cleaners     An upright vacuum can cost as much as $900 or even more. But for $50 the  Dirt Devil Featherlite Bagless M085845  sold at Target was a good performer in our tests and a CR Best Buy. The 13-pound bagless upright has HEPA filtration and was excellent at removing pet hair, a vacuum&#8217;s toughest task. At that price, you can buy one for your second floor and avoid lugging your main vacuum up and down the stairs. Now, that\'s a gift.    \r\n')

Apple\xe2\x80\x99s products have changed not just how  we communicate but what we communicate and even, arguably, what we  think. The phenomenon McLuhan identified was one of framing, of  inadvertent shaping: a group that watches a political debate on  television may have a different take on who won than the group that  listened on the radio. Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s approach had a teleological dimension. "A  lot of times, people don\'t know what they want until you show it to  them," he once said. With his products, the medium often made the  message. Unlike something like Twitter or Facebook, where developers  have seemed content to let users repurpose and improvise, Apple has a  more interventionist ethos: here is the product, you should use it to do  this, and if you need help, go to the Genius bar. It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to  his phenomenal career that this only seems like a part of his legacy.To  some extent, this is just as McLuhan predicted. Apple has a distinctive  aesthetic that prioritises simplicity and straightforwardness.

Last year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Friday\xe2\x80\x9d day-after-Thanksgiving sale on Amazon.com was popular, and this year the major online retailer is extending the event throughout the week leading up to Thanksgiving, and offering publicized deals throughout the entire month of November, counting down to the start of \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Friday Deals Week.\xe2\x80\x9d    The  Black Friday Deals Week Countdown  features electronics, home and kitchen, and jewelry, but Amazon has deals throughout all categories. The featured deals follow the style of Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLightning Deals,\xe2\x80\x9d where the retailer offers a usually deeply discounted item every several hours in limited quantities and for a limited time. The deals are not announced ahead of time, so in order to take advantage, shoppers would need to check Amazon.com often.    Shopping online beats running around from store to store on Black Friday, running the risk of being trampled by crazy shoppers. On the other hand, you may miss out on a retailer\xe2\x80\x99s best doorbuster-type deals if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the house. Some companies take advantage of the fact that this is the one time of the year that a large population of consumers are obsessed with finding great deals, and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for retailers to present an offer as a once-in-a-lifetime discount for shoppers who haven\xe2\x80\x99t properly researched their desires. An event like Black Friday also open the opportunity for retailers to take advantage of the impulse reaction, leading people to buy what they don\xe2\x80\x99t need simply for the feeling of scoring a great deal.    Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve become lazier over the last few years. Except in a few specific situations, namely photography equipment, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that Amazon.com consistently offers lower prices on the items I find myself needing or wanting most often. I often don\xe2\x80\x99t bother to shop around unless it\xe2\x80\x99s for a major purchase. If Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s price ends up being slightly higher, I don\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much. Thanks to all the money I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved over the past decade, my overall savings compared with shopping at retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City more than make up for the difference.     How closely will you monitor Amazon.com\xe2\x80\x99s  Black Friday Deals Week Countdown?   I might visit the site several times a week to see what the trends are.

Like America, Europe has vast beds of shale rock, in which innumerable bubbles of natural gas are trapped. By cannoning water, sand and chemicals at them, a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or \xe2\x80\x9cfracking\xe2\x80\x9d, the bubbles can be released. This, the firms said, could bring Europe the same bonanza of cheap gas and new jobs in the industry that America is now enjoying (see  article ). It would also lessen Europe\xe2\x80\x99s irksome dependence on Russian gas.Outside the venue, meanwhile, protesters chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cFlaming water from our tap, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want this fracking crap.\xe2\x80\x9d They referred to fears that fracking can cause contamination of aquifers by the methane and naturally occurring radioactive material it displaces, or by the chemicals it uses.

BIG numbers and online crime go together. One well-worn assertion is that cybercrime revenues exceed those from the global trade in illegal drugs. Another nice round number is the $1 trillion-worth of intellectual property that, one senator claimed earlier this year, cybercriminals snaffle annually.  It is hard to know what to make of these numbers. Online crooks, like their real-world brethren, do not file quarterly reports. In the absence of figures from the practitioners, experts tend to fall back on surveys of victims, often compiled by firms that sell security software. These have a whiff of self interest about them: they are the kind of studies that get press released but not peer reviewed.  A paper by two researchers at Microsoft, Dinei Florencio and Cormac Herley, shows why: because losses are unevenly distributed. Most people never have their bank accounts raided by cyber criminals, but an unfortunate few do, and lose a lot. This means that ...   \r\n')

Unions are, for example, outraged at the $21m paid in 2009 to Sam Palmisano, IBM\xe2\x80\x99s boss, not least because his firm laid off 10,000 workers in America last year.

That threshold was  undefined, as was the timeline, but 50% is the figure being bandied  about.The concern is that the law would apply retroactively, prompting  large divestments in important banks. Why on earth would Indonesia uproot the ownership structure of its  banking system? The plans were leaked in the more tranquil days of May.  But last week the Indonesian stock market collapsed by 8.8%, and the  dollar/rupiah touched 9,350, a nearly 10% drop since its high a week ago.  Part of this is the (hopefully temporary) shortage of greenbacks in Europe that is driving a pullback of dollar credit lines from  Southeast Asia. But it\'s also a reminder that Southeast Asia remains a  "risk-on" trade, subject to capital flows when the good times are  rolling, and teeth-chattering fear when the end is nigh. Regulators  cannot take investor sentiment for granted. If no bank owner can own more than 50%, then everybody is a minority  shareholder.

Today, holiday light displays can be found in nearly every major city and small town across the country and holiday revelers hike, drive and even boat to see the lights as part of their family traditions.          We put together a list of 10 of the best holiday displays in the country; some you may know well and some may enlighten you:          The Country Club Plaza: Kansas City, Mo.     One of the most popular holiday traditions in Kansas City and throughout the Midwest is the Plaza lighting ceremony on Thanksgiving night. Thousands flock from all over the Midwest to see 80 miles of lights -- more than 280,000 twinkling bulbs -- get switched on. The lighting ceremony is such a huge deal in the metropolitan area that it is broadcast on live television for the people who don't want to brave the cold or the throngs of revelers. One of the most outstanding seats for the show is from a room in The Raphael Hotel or InterContinental Hotel, both of which overlook the Plaza. If you miss the switch being thrown on Thanksgiving night, no worries. The lights twinkle nightly through mid-January.                            The holiday spirit often needs a little help from an outrageously awesome holiday lights display.                    ...                                                    \r\n")

The showing was especially painful because target-date funds are supposed to protect assets in downturns by holding diversified mixes of stocks and bonds.

The blog goes on to have Rooney ask for someone to find out what actually killed him. This has offended some respondents who, blinded by their own biases, think a writer using a celebrity\xe2\x80\x99s death to push for information that could be used to improve care is the same thing as accusing his physicians of negligence or hauling Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s family into court to publicly disclose private details.   \r\n')

"We carried an undue burden for protecting the European banking system from contagion," said finance minister Michael Noonan.      "We are looking at ways to reduce the debt. We would like to see our European colleagues address this in a positive manner. Wherever there is a reckless borrower, there is also a reckless lender," he said, alluding to German, French, British and Dutch banks.      Mr Noonan hinted that Dublin is asking for some of interested relief on a \xe2\x82\xac31bn EU promissory noted linked to the Anglo Irish fiasco, among other matters.      Mr Noonan said Ireland\'s public mood has turned very sour.       "We have indicated to Europe\'s authorities that it will be difficult to get the Irish public to pass a referendum on treaty change," he said.       Mr Noonan said the country will stay the course with unbending austerity, even though nominal gross national product (GNP) has already contracted by 22pc. Public wages have fallen 12pc on average under Ireland\'s "internal devaluation" policy to regain competitiveness within EMU. There are likely to be further wage cuts in the December budget.      "We have to face reality. There is no painless way, no soft option: we\'re going to cut spending drastically, but with social cohesion. We don\'t want situation we see in Greece with people on streets and the foundations of state under threat. We\'re not going that route."   Will, Not May       Pritchard summed up the entire situation quite nicely in his opening lead " Europe\'s plans for treaty changes to enforce fiscal discipline in the eurozone  may  fall foul of popular anger in Ireland unless the EU creditor states agree to share more of the pain. "      My one quibble is with the word "may". The correct word is will.      I am quite disappointed that it took Ireland this long. Voters smashed the Fianna Fail (FF) party to smithereens in February (see  Massive Rout in Irish Elections; Collision Course with the EU; Default the Best Option for Ireland ), to teary-eyed outgoing politicians, only to see incoming party Fine Gael, led by incoming prime minister Enda Kenny, do the exact same thing FF would have done: bail out German and French banks at the expense of Irish taxpayers.      Quite frankly this is maddening. What the hell good are elections if the only choice by either party is to bail out the banks? Worse yet, in Ireland\'s situation, it is foreign banks that are bailed out.       Enda Kenny "Pleads" for Help        Actually, Kenny did not "demand" debt relief, he begged for it. Moreover he is willing to kiss ass to get it.      The Wall Street Journal reports  Irish PM Kenny: Must Meet Targets To Win Back Economic Sovereignty     Ireland will have to meet the austerity budget targets set by its bailout lenders if the country is to get its economic sovereignty back, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said Tuesday.      He told the Irish parliament that looming budget measures will be as fair as possible to balance the requirements of its European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders while protecting the most vulnerable in Irish society.      "Clearly, if we are to have our economic sovereignty back we can\'t go on as we were," Kenny said.  If Kenny had any backbone at all he would have told the IMF and EU to "go to hell" just as Icelandic voters did and more importantly, just as Irish voters expected. Instead, Kenny wimped-out to the exact same demands from the IMF and EU that Fianna Fail would have done.       Public Mood Turns Sour        Mr Noonan, Ireland\'s finance minister said "Ireland\'s public mood has turned very sour".      Of course it has. Wimps like Kenny and Noonan have caved into every EU and IMF demand, at the expense of Irish taxpayers, in spite of an overwhelming election to do something different!      I repeat what I said earlier today in  Eventually, Will Come a Time When ....        Eventually, there will come a time when a populist office-seeker will  stand before the voters, hold up a copy of the EU treaty and (correctly)  declare all the "bail out" debt foisted on their country to be null and  void. That person will be elected.       Kenny did not do what he was elected to do. He should be kicked out of office on his ass and replaced by someone who will.

Savings accounts, particularly so-called \xe2\x80\x9chigh-yield\xe2\x80\x9d savings accounts, are best for money you might need within a year. Any money that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to subject to the short-term risk and volatility in the stock market should be held safe in a savings account, earning as much interest as possible. Your emergency fund should primarily consist of money held in a high-yield savings account. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-yield\xe2\x80\x9d is unfortunately a bit of a misnomer these days; a decade ago, interest rates were 4% and 5% among select savings accounts and money market accounts. Today, the best rates are all below 2% with most around 1%. This trend will continue until banks need more cash from depositors.     Interest rates.  Interest rates are important because money shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose too much purchasing power. In a perfect world, interest rates offered by banks should beat inflation while preserving the balance without risk. Many banks are not now offering a savings option with interest rates high enough to meaningfully beat inflation, so if your savings is at a brick and mortar bank earning below 0.25% APY, choose one of the better options below.     Customer service.  When evaluating customer service, there are two important factors to consider. The best banks offer all account maintenance and transfers through a professional, reliable, and easy-to-navigate website. Secondly, live customer service representatives should be knowledgeable, helpful, and available, although customers should have to deal with a representative infrequently if at all.    Based on my own experiences and reviews from other Consumerism Commentary readers, here are the most-recommended accounts for short-term savings. All of the listed interest rates are current as of November 2011, but they are subject to change by the banks. Although I have nine accounts listed below the table of rates, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to have accounts with that many different banks. Choose one that fits you the best.    First, here is a list of the latest interest rates. Following this table, I offer a few of my own observations and opinions about savings accounts from nine popular online banks.        <!--  function getQueryStringVariable(variable) {  var query = window.location.search.substring(1);  var vars = query.split(\'&\');  for (var i=0;i<vars.length;i++) {  var pair = vars[i].split(\'=\');  if (pair[0] == variable) {  return pair[1];}}}  // -->  <!--  var ni_ad_client = "326267";  var ni_rp = getQueryStringVariable(\'type\');  var ni_amt = getQueryStringVariable(\'amount\');  var ni_rpt = getQueryStringVariable(\'term\');  var                    ni_amt = \'19999\',                      ni_rp = \'7\',                      ni_rpt = \'15\';  // -->      \r\n')

This is where the borders of three countries, Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, converge.But the serenity was shattered on October 5th by the sight of corpses floating downriver. Thirteen Chinese from two commercial vessels had been shot dead near Chiang Saen port and their bodies tossed overboard. Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s police found over 920,000 amphetamine tablets on board the boats, plying between China\xe2\x80\x99s Yunnan province and the Thai port. An angry Chinese government suspended its shipping on the Mekong until better security could be put in place. The ministers of China\xe2\x80\x99s three Mekong neighbours were summoned to Beijing for urgent talks.At first the Thai army unit with responsibility for anti-narcotics and border security blamed the killings on an armed group of drug-trafficking bandits led by the notorious Naw Kham. But then a huge investigation led by the head of the Thai police, General Priewpan Damapong, sprang a surprise.

This is part two of my multi-post commentary on the Euro area Balance of Payments (BoP).   Yesterday, in part one , I compared the EA current account balance to its country-level cross section. Today\xe2\x80\x99s post will be more instructive in nature, as I dig into the components of the EA current account (CA) and capital account (KA) balances.    My general conclusion is that the EA is highly dependent on foreign demand for EA assets in the identity of its international accounts.    As a note: remember the standard international finance identity: CA + KA + errors and omissions = 0, where CA + KA is generally referred to as the Balance of Payments. An international  guide to the BoP can be found at the IMF website  . Generally, the EA BoP statistics adhere to the IMF definitions.     The Current Account     The chart below illustrates the 3-month accumulated current account balance as the sum of its components: the goods balance (exports minus imports of goods), the service balance (exports minus imports of services), net foreign income, and unilateral transfers. The goods, services, and income balance is \xe2\x82\xac 16.2 for the three months ending in September, which is more than offset by the unilateral transfer balance, -\xe2\x82\xac 28.1 billion.    The transfer debits are generally to and from other EU institutions and other non-EU and non G7 countries (see  section 7.3, table 9 ), which reflects subsidies from the EA to EU budgets, remittance payments, and aid to developing economies. Given the stability in these outflows, this should be no cause for concern at this time. Of note, the goods balance shrunk spanning 2003 to current, while the service balance improved. In Q3 2011, the goods balance was just \xe2\x82\xac1 billion, while the services balance was \xe2\x82\xac15.    The trade and income balances balances generally fund the transfer outflows. However, recently the transfer balance has picked up (-\xe2\x82\xac28.1 bn in the three months ending in September, which is up from -\xe2\x82\xac19 or -\xe2\x82\xac20 bn in the same month of 2004 and 2005). Given the dropoff in the trade and income balance, something is funding these unilateral outflows: the capital account.                The Capital Account     The chart below illustrates the 3-month accumulated capital account balance as a sum of its components: net portfolio flows (Port Inv \xe2\x80\x93 Bal, generally financial assets), foreign direct investment (FDI, or stickier capital flows), financial derivatives, \xe2\x80\x98other investments\xe2\x80\x99, and official reserves (ECB asset accumulation).    Since the crisis started, there\xe2\x80\x99s been an stark inflow of foreign money (positive green bars) into the Euro area. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably worth looking at this alongside the US TIC data to gauge interest in USD denominated assets for a proxy of global portfolio diversification \xe2\x80\x93 another post \xe2\x80\x93 I digress. The EA foreign direct investment is, and has generally been, negative. Foreign direct investment is long-term investment in other countries, including the retention of earnings for investment, equity investment, or long and short term loans. Most of the FDI is leaving the EA for the UK, \xe2\x80\x98other EU countries (those not UK, Sweden, or Denmark, and \xe2\x80\x9cother countries\xe2\x80\x9d (likely EM countries in Asia and Latin America). You can see this information in  section 7.3, Table 9 . Official reserve asset accumulation is generally very small \xe2\x80\x93 one can barely see it in this illustration -  and picks up in times of stress (like in 2008).    One interesting aspect of this data has been the persistently negative flows in \xe2\x80\x98other investments\xe2\x80\x99.  Section 7.3, Tables 5-6  indicate this is driven by outflows in the banking sector (MFI\xe2\x80\x99s). I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to this in another post; but there\xe2\x80\x99s been a steady reduction to EA MFI\xe2\x80\x99s via short-term loans.           The important feature of recent developments in the capital account is the sharp dropoff of the portfolio balance in September, just \xe2\x82\xac31.5 bn over the last three months from \xe2\x82\xac104.5 bn in the three months through August. This could be a one-off event; but the reduced foreign demand for EA assets could be problematic if a trend forms.    I would say that the EA BoP is not the most stable of all international flows. It\xe2\x80\x99s now heavily dependent on portfolio flows \xe2\x80\x93 the green bars in the chart above - given the persistently negative foreign direct investment flows. Better put: the EA current account deficit is now funding through international asset flows into debt, equity, and lending markets. Given the deterioration of the sovereign debt crisis, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if these flows slowed further in coming months/quarters without a broad policy response from within Europe. Given the persistence of the transfer outflows, waning foreign demand for EA assets would pressure the currency downward if trade remains sluggish.    originally published at  The Wilder View...Economonitors       \r\n')

A stem cell is one that, when it divides, spins off some offspring that remain as stem cells while others turn into functional tissue. Stem cells found in embryos can spin off a wide range of tissue types. Those found in adults are more limited: turning into blood cells, say, or muscle cells.The bad news for those who have hopes of the field is that Geron, an American firm that was a pioneer of the therapeutic use of stem cells, is pulling out of the business. It is ending (or selling, if it can find a buyer) a project that was testing embryonic stem cells as a treatment for people paralysed by injuries to their spinal cords. The reason, it said, is financial. At a time when it is hard to raise new capital, the firm has decided to concentrate on anticancer therapies that, it hopes, are nearer to being commercial propositions than the stem-cell study is.The good news for the field of stem-cell therapy comes from a paper published in this week\xe2\x80\x99s...    \r\n')

Presenting her \xe2\x80\x9cpresidential project\xe2\x80\x9d, Ms Le Pen said Europe should give up the euro, which had \xe2\x80\x9casphyxiated our economies, killed our industries and choked our jobs\xe2\x80\x9d for years, as well as causing France to accumulate \xe2\x80\x9cHimalayan\xe2\x80\x9d debts. In any case, she added, the country should prepare a planned exit from the currency union. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to anticipate the collapse of the euro rather than suffer from the collapse of the euro,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a television interview on Sunday. Le Pen supports misguided policies on trade and numerous other issues. However, protectionists and isolationists will eventually win the way, on one issue and one issue alone.      Last April, in Finland, the "True Finn" party soared from obscurity based on one simple idea:  stopping bailouts of euro-zone member states . The rest of the "True Finn" platform was cancerous, yet meaningless. Voters everywhere are fed up with bailouts.       My Point       Eventually, there will come a time when a populist office-seeker will stand before the voters, hold up a copy of the EU treaty and (correctly) declare all the "bail out" debt foisted on their country to be null and void. That person will be elected.      Le Pen may be too early, and France may not be that country, but the time will come.      Greece, Finland, Germany, Belgium, and even France are possibilities. All it will take, is for one charismatic person, timing social mood correctly, to say precisely one right thing at exactly the right time. It will happen.

But not all emerging bond funds have suffered equally. During the past three months, Fidelity New Markets Income  about broke even. The fund avoided trouble by following the cautious approach favored by portfolio manager John Carlson. The Fidelity manager shuns the lowest-quality bonds and emphasizes government securities that are issued in dollars -- not in foreign currencies. The dollar bonds often prove resilient in downturns.

But how many of them are actually willing to sacrifice profit for principle? When pressed, most of them simply argue that they are doing good by doing well, which prompts the question of why they bother to talk about CSR in the first place. I was delighted to discover, in Michael Eisner\'s "Working Together: Why Great Parternships Succeed", that Ross Perot, the founder of Electronic Data Services and two-times presidential candidate, was an exception to this rule, a man who was willing to sacrifice a quick buck in pursuit of a deeply-held principle. In the late 1970s Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus visited Mr Perot in Dallas to finalise plans for him to take a 70% share in what became Home Depot. Noticing that Mr Blank sported a moustache, Mr Perot said that he had a strict no-facial-hair policy. He made his investment conditional on the removal of the offending hair. Mr Blank refused and took their idea elsewhere. Mr Perot lost billions by turning down the deal, but nevertheless held up the wider principle that companies need to set an example of good personal grooming to the world.   \r\n')

In each chart, the blue shading represents the sector\'s "normal" trading range, which is between one standard deviation above and below the 50-day moving average (the white line).  The red zone represents between one and two standard deviations above the 50-day, while the green zone represents between one and two standard deviations below the 50-day.  Moves into or above the red zone are considered overbought, while moves into or below the green zone are considered oversold.    While the S&amp;P 500 has pulled back more than 8% since its intraday high on October 27th, it\'s still trading within its "normal" trading range.  To get to oversold, the index needs to fall another 2.11%.  For bears that are hoping for farther declines, there is still quite a bit of downside room to run before an oversold bounce would be expected.           The Financial sector continues to look the worst from a technical perspective.  The sector remains in a long-term downtrend, and it has once again moved to the bottom of its normal trading range.  A few more days of declines and the sector will be right back to its lows for the year.  Most sectors are trading in either sideways or downtrend patterns.  The Utilities sector is the only one that is trading in a long-term uptrend, but it has gotten hit  especially   hard  in recent weeks.

You can shop smart by following a couple of steps you may not have considered yet, such as making your purchases at highly rated retailers, and trying your hand at haggling.        Buy online:  In our  report on where to buy electronics , Amazon.com, BHPhotoVideo.com, Crutchfield.com, and Newegg.com all received strong marks from readers who responded to our electronics retailer survey. Those four were also standouts for shipping and home delivery.       Overall, online merchants did better than walk-in retailers, even for big-ticket items like TVs. For walk-in stores, independent retailers topped our  Ratings  (available to subscribers). The Apple Store, Costco, and Staples also got high scores.      A  separate survey of computer buyers  found more overall satisfaction with online vendors than with walk-in stores ( Ratings  available to subscribers.) Just 2 percent of computer shoppers who dealt with online retailers said they paid more than expected, but more than half of walk-in buyers spent more than expected. Highest-rated walk-in stores for computers were the Apple Store, Micro Center, and Costco.      Newegg.com was the only retailer in our electronics-shopping survey to receive top marks for price. Crutchfield.com stood alone among online retailers for having top-of-the-line customer service.       Haggle:  Just 13 percent of shoppers said they tried haggling at walk-in stores. But those who did saved an average of $82. Shoppers saved a median of $105 on televisions, $53 on digital cameras, and $43 on DVD/Blu-ray players.       Four in five hagglers negotiated the price of their purchases at HHGregg, P.C. Richard & Son, and independent walk-in stores. At Best Buy and Sears, at least three in five hagglers shaved dollars off the prices they paid. Hagglers for computers were successful more than half the time; the average savings was a whopping $103.      You can also haggle for a discount online. Our survey found that nearly three of five were successful in scoring a price break, even though few even think to try in the first place. A third of them negotiated with a retailer by phone vs. 29 percent through e-mail messages and 13 percent by online chat. Two-thirds of computer buyers who negotiated directly with manufacturers got a lower price.      For more advice check out  7 tips for organized and hassle-free holiday shopping .

Morever, in both Serbia and Montenegro the system of government is clear. When those countries export dairy products, eggs and meat, (including Serbia's specialty pork), will all have a stamp of approval from EU-compliant agencies, which will test and certify that their produce is fit for import to the union.Bosnia is another story.

Greece is obvious enough and a government collapsed over it.    Spain is obvious enough and a government collapsed over it.    Italy is obvious enough and a government collapsed over it.    Portugal is obvious enough and a government collapsed over it.    US is obvious enough and the failure of the super-committee to come to agreement is proof enough       In the UK, news is just as "reassuring" as Prime Minister David Cameron says " Our Plan to Cut Debt is Failing "    David Cameron and his senior ministers have admitted for the first time that there is a danger they will not be able to tackle borrowing on time.       The Prime Minister on Monday conceded that tackling Britain\xe2\x80\x99s debts was \xe2\x80\x9cproving harder than anyone envisaged\xe2\x80\x9d, raising the prospect that the Coalition would be unable to close the deficit by 2014-15.      That would rule out any significant tax cuts before the next election. It also raises questions about the Coalition\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental purpose.      Departing from the deficit-reduction timetable could raise fears that Britain will face rising borrowing costs as bond markets take fright.      Debt is \xe2\x80\x9ca drag on growth\xe2\x80\x9d, Mr Cameron told business leaders. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are well behind where we need to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.       Kenneth Clarke, the Justice Secretary, has warned that the global economy is \xe2\x80\x9cin a devil of a mess\xe2\x80\x9d, which is \xe2\x80\x9cbound to have an effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the Coalition\xe2\x80\x99s plans to clear most of the deficit before the next election.      The candid remarks pave the way for George Osborne, the Chancellor, to admit next week that his target will be missed and the structural deficit will not be erased until at least 2015-16. The odds Cameron will succeed by 2016 are the same as the odds he would succeed by 2014. Zero.      At least the UK admits failure. In the US we have a situation best described as  Mission Accomplished: Nothing; Kerry Says No Problem "Lawmakers Have a Year"; Boehner\'s, Pelosi\'s "Moral Obligations" Fly Out the Window       Mission a Brilliant Success, Achieves 100% of Its Goals       The Super Committee accomplished nothing, as expected, and more  importantly, as designed. Neither political party really wanted to do  anything about the deficit (because it would cost them votes). By D.C.  standards this mission was a "brilliant success". It achieved its  purpose, which was to do nothing. Both parties got the smoke-and-mirrors  delay they wanted, while pointing fingers at the other side.  One Success Story       Those looking for a success story can find it in Iceland. It truly is different in Iceland because Icelandic citizens were actually give a chance to vote on what to do, and vote they did against the wishes of parliament, to tell the IMF and EU to go to hell (twice I need to add, because incompetent politicians were hell-bent on stopping default following the first vote).       Iceland defaulted. The result has been spectacular. Iceland is well on its way to recovery.      Meanwhile, PIIGS flounder around like fish out of water, shoved bales of austerity and ordered by outsiders and unelected officials to breathe.       The current situation is hopeless. Politicians either need to accept that fact, or put things to a vote like Iceland did.      Serious restructuring and a breakup of the Eurozone is the only solution.

In October Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, visited the eastern city of Wenzhou, where entrepreneurs have suffered gravely from the credit crunch. Taxmen and regulators should go easy, he said, on banks that lend to small companies. Mr Wen later visited a special economic zone in Tianjin and said banks and local governments should give high-tech firms their full support. In October bank lending quickened, filling some of the gap left by shadow lenders.But this easing remains subtle. Mr Wen and other officials have begun to talk of \xe2\x80\x9cfine-tuning\xe2\x80\x9d, suggesting existing controls may be a semitone too sharp, but no more.

Drop your gold jewelry in the envelope and mail it to them.    They send you a check.       Easy peasy, right? It is. The catch is that some of these places really give you almost nothing compared to  what your gold jewelry is worth .\xc2\xa0 Of ten sites listed on one comparison site, the top one paid almost eight times the bottom one for the same gold necklace.\xc2\xa0 The top site, ExpressGoldCash.com, currently pays $26.43 for 14kt gold, per pennyweight.\xc2\xa0 (This is the payout for the lowest quantity tier, which is zero to five ounces.\xc2\xa0 If you send in more than that, they pay more per DWT.)    The real question is this, though:\xc2\xa0 How does it compare to gold spot price?\xc2\xa0 One pennyweight of 14kt gold is about 0.02917 troy ounces, so ExpressGoldCash is paying out just north of $900 per troy ounce.\xc2\xa0 Spot price is $1,626 per ounce, so they\xe2\x80\x99re paying out more than half of spot for the gold.    All in all, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty darn good, considering what they have to do to recoup their purchase.\xc2\xa0 They have to handle the business costs of shipping the goods, paying you, and insuring your jewelry in transit.\xc2\xa0 Then they have to test your item to see that the purity is as advertised.\xc2\xa0 Then they have to melt the stuff and get it into a form that can be sold (usually a three-nines bar).    Here\xe2\x80\x99s another reason I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a good price.\xc2\xa0  They advertise what they pay prominently on their site. \xc2\xa0 They know they pay out a lot for the gold, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a selling point.\xc2\xa0 As I went down the list on the comparison site I visited, the top three listed their current payouts.\xc2\xa0 (On the third one a little more digging was necessary to get the price, but it was there.)\xc2\xa0 The other sites did not advertise their prices.\xc2\xa0 The sites that pay out less don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know how little they pay out until they have your items in hand.    So the takeaway is if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use a cash for gold place on the web, then make sure at least that they advertise what they will pay you right on the site.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be finding out at the time you get your check.

One question that hasn't been asked, however, is what happens if (when) German yields start to come unanchored?    We may have an answer to that question sooner than most would have expected.  In the chart below we compare the spreads on German 10-year Bunds relative to 10-year US Treasuries.  For much of the last several months, German Bunds have been yielding less than US treasuries.  After today's failed auction in Germany, though, German 10-year Bunds are yielding 13 basis more than 10-year US Treasuries, which is a level that hasn't been seen since May 2009.  Looked at in a historical context, current levels are hardly anything to panic about, but as we have seen with other countries in recent weeks, the spike in spreads seems to come all at once, and once it occurs, it is usually too late.

FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has reportedly filed an order requesting that the other four commissioners vote to have an administrative law judge hear the case, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier today.       This past summer, the  U.S. Department of Justice filed its own suit  to block AT&T\'s proposed $39 billion deal to acquire T-Mobile. The FCC\'s hearing would occur after the DOJ\'s pending lawsuit is settled, and would only go forward if the proposed merger is not blocked by that current suit. The DOJ trial is set to begin in 2012.       In a statement to our sister site, The Consumerist, Larry Solomon, AT&T\'s senior vice president of Corporate Communications wrote: "The FCC\'s action today is disappointing. It is yet another example of a government agency acting to prevent billions in new investment and the creation of many thousands of new jobs at a time when the US economy desperately needs both."      Parul Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports said in a statement:        We believe it is critical for the FCC to examine the consequences of a combined AT&T/T-Mobile, including higher prices, fewer choices, and the negative impact on competition in the wireless market -- all which make it clear that this merger is simply not in the public&#8217;s best interest.      According to  our analysis of the voice and data plans available from AT&T and T-Mobile , T-Mobile wireless plans typically cost $15-$50 per month less than comparable plans from AT&T.

Looking at Optimal Tax Rates   Via  Paul Krugman , I learned of  this paper  by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez.  Diamond, of course, is a Nobel Laureate.  I will be shocked if Saez isn't one too in ten or fifteen years.  Long story made very short, Diamond and Saez jump through a lot of hoops and find that the optimal top marginal income tax rate (all in, that is, including federal, state and local), which they define as maximizing social welfare, is about 73%.    Now, long time readers may recall I've been doing this sort of analysis for years, though of course I've been looking at tax rates that maximize real GDP growth.  Simply put, you cannot maximize long run social welfare if you aren't maximizing economic growth.      My approach is much simpler than that followed by Diamond and Saez.  I like to think its much more intuitive and easier to explain.  I note that US data shows a simple quadratic relationship between real GDP growth from one year to the next and tax rates:  growth in real GDP, t to t+1 = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared, other variables)  One recent post on the topic is  here .   ( Unlike the Laffer curve , the coefficients come out statistically significant and with the right signs.)    I mention all this to note that no matter what I throw into the equation, I find that the top marginal tax rate that maximizes economic growth is somewhere around 65%.  Of course, I've focused only on federal tax rates... add in state and local it comes pretty close to what Diamond and Saez have found.  As I noted above, my approach is somewhat simpler, and easier to follow than that of Diamond and Saez.  Part of the reason is that they come at it from a point of view of elasticities.  But with all due respect to my betters (Diamond and Saez, and Krugman as well considering the explanation in his post) I think this is the wrong way to consider the problem.  It requires all sorts of assumptions and generalizations about people's behavior, some of which are both false and create resistance from folks on the right.    For example, there is a notion that raising tax rates will reduce people's willingness to work... which is only true above certain thresholds.  (That threshold, of course, varies per individual.)  As anyone who has ever had a business will tell you (when they're not busy demanding tax reductions), you don't pay taxes on income from the business if you turn around and reinvest that income.  (An accountant would talk to you about decreasing your tax liability by increasing expenses which amounts to the same thing.)  You only pay taxes on that income you take that income out, presumably for consumption purposes.  So to simplify, consider an example....  is a successful businessperson more likely to take money out of the business if his/her tax rate is 70% or if its 25%?  In general, a person is more likely to take that money at 25%, as there's less of a penalty.  At 70% tax rates, there is more of an incentive to reinvest in the business, creating more growth in the business in subsequent years, and more economic growth thereafter.  70% tax rates are more likely to generate faster economic growth than 25% tax rates precisely because people are self-interested and the higher tax rates induce people to continue investing in things they do well.  (Of course, tax rates can get too high.  At 95%, people will reinvest almost every dime... even if they have exhausted every good investment opportunity they have.  Thus, to avoid taxes they'll be making lousy investments which in turn slow economic growth.)    Still, its gratifying to see others who are more, er, credentialed doing similar work.  If I might end on a digression, though, I can think of a number of examples of work being done on blogs by people who are essentially hobbyists which is somewhat ahead of the academic literature.  However, to a large extent, if something wasn't published in the academic literature, for all practical purposes it didn't happen.  Which is a shame, because most of us who aren't academics don't have time or the resources required for such publication (such as access to econlit).  That inevitably slows economic development three ways:  1.  the lack of recognition discourages hobbyists who have the potential and otherwise would have the willingness to improve on the existing literature 2.  should such hobbyists persist and do the research, that research will not be widely disseminated even if it is an improvement over the academic literature 3.  it maintains an insular attitude among those who are not hobbyists.  As smart as Diamond, Saez, and Krugman all are, none of them are thinking the way someone running a business thinks of they'd have realized immediately how people who are running a business react to higher and lower tax rates.  I have read a lot of academic papers on taxation and have yet to stumble on one that gets it right.   ---  Thanks to Steve Roth of  Asymptosis  and Jazzbumpa of  Retirement Blues  for notifying me of Krugman's post.

Fighters might also link up with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a regional terror group. This comes at a time of growing radicalism in Mali and Niger, with illiterate and disillusioned citizens finding solace in mosques.Yet talk of Tuareg uprisings is often overstated. For all their swagger and Star Wars-style dress, the Tuareg are not numerous. Mali has 75,000 in a population of 15m. Some rebel groups may contain no more than a few dozen fighters. The main threat from the Libyan revolution to its southern neighbours is the economic...    \r\n')

It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the representative could use some education in the making friends and influencing people department, but what is also revealed is a shocking dose of candid insight:      \xe2\x80\xa6 The rep said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the bank\xe2\x80\x99s fault, and blamed the government. She said the federal government capped overdraft fees, and so they just \xe2\x80\x9chad\xe2\x80\x9d to raise these fees to \xe2\x80\x9ccover their losses\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\xa6.      Price controls make everyone worse off in the long run. \xc2\xa0 Capping overdraft fees is a form of price control: the price a bank can charge a customer for the privilege of spending more than they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to in their account.\xc2\xa0 The government got involved as the result of backlash from something or other \xe2\x80\x94 people  ask  or even  beg  the government to get involved in matters! \xe2\x80\x94 and the profitable \xe2\x80\x9cfrequent fliers\xe2\x80\x9d of the bank customer pool aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite so profitable anymore.\xc2\xa0 So, the bank needs to find ways to make other customers profitable, such as the responsible ones who spend within the confines of their balance.    Prices like to move freely so they can arrive at the price that\xe2\x80\x99s best for everyone.\xc2\xa0 With controls the price must settle somewhere outside of optimal, and other prices must adjust around the controlled price.\xc2\xa0 Like $3 or $5 monthly fees where there were none before.\xc2\xa0 Overall, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much that we can do about it.\xc2\xa0 We can vote with our feet like the Reddit poster did, but even though he made the point that some other banks and credit unions haven\xe2\x80\x99t upped their fees yet, I tend to side with the bank rep:      \xe2\x80\xa6 The rep got a little anxious, too, when my wife asked about the procedure for closing our account, and actually started arguing with my wife, saying that it was pointless to move our money because \xe2\x80\x9cother banks and even the credit unions are going to do it too!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\xa6.     Whether the additional cost comes in the form of a monthly fee or something else, the cost will show up.\xc2\xa0 The overdraft income was gone with the stroke of a pen (and a whole bunch of yea votes).\xc2\xa0 Now we all adjust.

And then they  confirmed two months ago that it was still going at Walmart\'s across the country . In spite of all this evidence that the nation\'s largest retailer needs to fix its gift receipt system, customers are still being screwed over when they try to return a gift.      Shellie Bailey-Shah, a reporter for KATU in Portland (the one on the left of the map) recently did some gift shopping at her nearby Walmart, Target and Fred Meyer stores.       When she went to return the purchases using gift receipts, the reporter had no problem getting the full amount back at both Target and Fred Meyer. Walmart was a very different story:    The cashier at the return counter tried repeatedly to scan each of the 10 gift receipts. She told Bailey-Shah that gift receipts "never work," and that the "system always has trouble with them," a statement Walmart has since disputed.      So instead, the clerk scanned the products\' bar codes which brought up the sale price of each item. She told Bailey-Shah that she\'d have to manually make adjustments, but somehow Bailey-Shah still didn\'t end up with all her money. She spent $92.69 but was refunded $79.21. Walmart pocketed $13.48.       This is the identical issue that was reported by the California reporters and confirmed by news stations in Texas and New Jersey earlier this year. And Walmart\'s response has been the same:    There appeared to be a scanning issue that required our associate to process the return differently. We take these matters seriously and apologize for any inconvenience... It\'s our expectation to refund the original purchase price when returning an item with a gift receipt... We are reviewing that process to look for ways to make it more efficient and reliable for our customers.       We think it\'s safe to say that this isn\'t a simple scanning issue but a serious systemic problem with Walmart\'s receipt-scanning process, one that the retailer doesn\'t seem to care much about fixing. Even if it is employee error at the stores where customers have been having this problem, that just means that Walmart is not training its staffers properly.      Thus, while we\'re not going to tell you to not do any holiday shopping at Walmart, we do advise that you keep the actual receipt for any gifts you purchase there, and if a gift\'s recipient is thinking about returning the present, you should probably make them aware of the problems that Walmart has been having with gift-receipt returns.

According to the sagas they had stones which could point to the sun, even when the sky was cloudy.No such sunstone has survived. But Guy Ropars of the University of Rennes, in France, thinks he knows what they were. He and his colleagues have been experimenting with a mineral called Iceland spar. Their results, just published in the  Proceedings of the Royal Society , suggest they are on to something.The passage of sunlight through the air polarises it. That means light from the sky itself points towards the sun, if you have the necessary equipment to detect the polarisation. Dr Ropars has shown that a piece of Iceland spar is sufficient.Iceland spar is a form of calcite that splits light into two beams. If the light is polarised, there is only one way to orient the crystal to produce beams of equal intensity. Find this orientation by looking through the crystal at the sky at a time when you can see the sun, mark the sun\xe2\x80\x99s direction on the crystal, and your mark will always point towards the sun when you match the beams from even a tiny patch of blue in an otherwise overcast sky.

Highly leveraged hedge funds contributed to the economic collapse, but the pressure to increase oversight has been mostly ignored by the industry. In response to heavy lobbying by the industry, the SEC has scaled back the requirements the commission intended to issue, leaving softer regulation likely to be ineffective.    Hedge fund managers like to keep their operations secret. If managers were required to report underlying investments, trades, and strategies, they might be at a disadvantage. Like a patented formula for creating pharmaceutical drugs, hedge fund managers rely on their proprietary operations to ensure no imitators and no rogue competitors using their strategies to cause them to fail. Most fund managers need to report their funds\xe2\x80\x99 financial details publicly, with statements that outline the funds\xe2\x80\x99 holdings, risk profile, expenses, and strategy. Hedge funds do not have this requirement.    The new SEC regulations allow hedge funds to file a minimum amount of data pertaining to the investments, and the filing will not be available to the public. Only a small committee within the SEC will be privileged enough to see the information. Additionally, only hedge funds with $1.5 billion in assets will be required to report the most detailed information to the SEC. Funds with over $500 million in assets need only report the extent that the investments are leveraged. Hedge funds with $150 million in assets or left will not be required to report anything.     The required reporting, which grows out of the financial crisis three years ago, is meant to allow financial regulators to monitor the risks that the funds may pose to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial system, something that officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the S.E.C. did not have during the crisis.     By focusing on the largest hedge funds, it may seem like the new reporting requirements will achieve this goal of monitoring and evaluating systemic risk. Considering that the largest hedge funds can still get away with reporting vague information about their underlying investments, the SEC may still miss big risks.    Should hedge funds be subject to the same scrutiny as publicly traded companies? Does the idea that very few investors take advantage of hedge funds release these managers from public accountability?

The adjustment rolls back a 0.5% penalty that was levied on the banks following a review last November. The PBOC was cited as saying in a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency that the reserve ratio was increased last year as a way of punishing banks for not lending enough to rural farming businesses.

The ECB may take the step to try to avoid a credit crisis across the euro zone, according to Reuters, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter. So far, the longest loan term the ECB has offered is one year, said Reuters. The news service said ECB officials had suggested longer loan terms to banks at a meeting last week. The pan-European stock index, the Stoxx Europe 600 , closed down a fraction Thursday, buffeted by Fitch Ratings' downgrade of Portugal's credit rating to junk status and German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissing talk of issuing euro bonds.

frantic search for hot-ticket items, and long lines at checkout. We have tips for helping you survive the hectic holiday scene, starting with mapping your strategy for smart holiday shopping.         According to our new holiday poll, shoppers say they will spend 19 hours hunting for the right gifts this holiday season, up four hours from last year. Despite this bump in time spent shopping, American\'s still overwhelming dread the crowds and long lines, at 68 percent of survey respondents. The right plan of attack can help alleviate some of that shopping stress.        Tips for organizing your holiday shopping:      Decide how much you\'ll spend, then add a bit more. Our holiday surveys have found that Americans typically spend more than they expect. In your spending estimate, include the holiday tips you plan to give to service providers such as a house cleaner or dog groomer, as well as gifts for party hosts.    Downsize in style. If your budget is smaller than last year, or your recipient list has grown, you can look for high-quality, lower-priced alternatives to your usual standbys. For wine, check out  Consumer Reports\' Best Buys , most for $10 or less. ( Ratings  available to subscribers.) One zinfandel we found\xe2\x80\x94Old Moon (2009)\xe2\x80\x94costs just $6 and is sold at Trader Joe\'s. Three 2009 shirazes\xe2\x80\x94Alice White, the Little Penguin, and Yellow Tail\xe2\x80\x94retail for about $7. If you\'re uncomfortable giving inexpensive wine as a gift, serve it in a carafe at your holiday table.    Check the Web first. The Web is a great tool for comparison shopping whether you buy online or prefer a local store. Our  recent survey of electronics shoppers  found that those who went to price-comparison websites were happier with the price they ended up paying whether they bought online or in a store. (Ratings available to subscribers.)    Some retailer websites will tell you whether an item you want is in stock at a particular store. Many, including Best Buy and Sears, will let you purchase an item online and pick it up at a local store, saving you shipping fees. In our  survey , consumers found shopping for electronics at Walmart.com a more satisfactory experience than shopping in a Walmart store. ( Ratings  available to subscribers.)    Shop alone, and forgo the ordeal known as Black Friday. Attempting to snag a door-buster bargain on Black Friday can be an exercise in frustration, with little chance of a rain check for that missed deal.    Night owls catch the worm as often as early birds during December, when many chain retailers extend their hours and sometimes offer "flash" in-store sales at odd hours. For example, last year 14 Macy\'s stores, mainly in the northeast, were open 83 consecutive hours, from 7 a.m. on Dec. 21 to 6 p.m. on Dec. 24, while other outlets stayed open until 2 a.m. Toys \'R Us stores had a similar promotion, opening at 6 a.m. on Dec. 21. Of course, the Internet is open around the clock.    Allow about 10 percent of your total holiday budget for the cost of wrapping, packing, and postage. To save on the cost of wrapping, you can also use old maps, the funny pages, and even old scraps of fabric for inexpensive, novel gift wrap.

reader Rick Cameron who made some observations and notes way back in 1992 and recently went back to review those notes.      His notes are regarding the  European ERM , the Exchange Rate Mechanism, that was supposed to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in Europe.       Before I list the thoughts of Cameron, here is some background information on the ERM and the countries involves:      The UK entered the ERM in 1990 but in 1992 Britain exited the ERM after the pound sterling came under pressure from George Soros, dubbing Soros as "the man who broke the Bank of England".      In 1993 the currency band had to be expanded 15% to accommodate speculation against the French franc and other currencies.      Wikepedia notes the ERM came to be known as an "Eternal Recession Mechanism" after Britain fell into recession during the early 1990s.       European ERM 1992 Replay        With that backdrop, please consider this Email from Cameron.    Hello Mish      I am a student of history, and I was an active investor in 1992. I have recently gone back and looked at my notes and the charts and the media comments about the UK and the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.       The parallels between the UK in 1992 and Germany in 2011 are striking.      Under the ERM, the (financially) stronger countries would be responsible for the weaker ones. Then the Berlin wall fell, the Eastern European countries tanked, and the UK was on the hook to support them.      There was lots of pressure on John Majors not to continue that policy and to leave the ERM. Political dithering followed, complete with bold speeches by both Brits and the Europeans about unity. The Brits held their ground in the face of enormous pressure on the pound, culminating with a $28B currency buyback in mid-September.       Students of history know what happened next: The Brits finally threw in the towel, left the ERM, and the pound tanked from $1.95 to 1.70 from September 19th to September 26th, then to $1.50 by November. George Soros made $2 billion.      Every article I read today about the ECB, the Germans, and the euro, resembles closely some similar article I have about the Bank of England, the British government, the ERM, and the eventual fall of the pound.      To me, it seems like an inevitable march down the same road - same players, same dithering, same posturing, same lack of attention to any of the real problems, same case of refusing to deal with any of the real issues - and sadly, the issues in 1992 were EXACTLY THE SAME as they are today.      Are the financially strong Northern European countries going to support the weaker Eastern and Southern European countries? Everyone in Europe loves the idea - until they have to write checks with their own money. Then it all come unglued, every time.      Finally, we need to not forget that the guy who stubbornly held onto the concept of the Brits supporting the ERM, no matter the cost and pain to the British taxpayers was none other than John Majors, who at the time was working on the Maastricht Treaty.       To quote Peter, Paul, and Mary "when will they ever learn?"      Have a good day      Rick Cameron  Same Issues, Same Players       Yes indeed. We have exactly the same issues and same players. Note that the UK is still on the outside looking in, with the rest of Europe clamoring to get the UK in.       The smart play would be for Cameron to stay on the outside, looking  out  as noted in  Will Cameron Sell UK Down the River for Worthless Promises? Two-Speed Europe and the Clutches of France        Since 1992, there has been an obvious change in political leadership. However, the politicians involved all still seek the same proverbial free lunch.       Irony of the  Maastricht Treaty       The irony of the Maastricht Treaty is that it did temporarily bring about the currency stability everyone wanted. However,  that currency stability came at the expense of something far worse - inherent interest rate  instability  (coupled with heightened fiscal  instability ).      It just took some time to play out.      Now, instead of attempting to defend untenable currency targets, the ECB, the Eurocrats, and the IMF all have their hands full attempting to maintain untenable interest rate targets. With yields soaring in Greece, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Belgium in relation to Germany, the Troika has failed.      To alleviate interest rate concerns and fiscal instability caused by the Maastricht Treaty, politicians now openly discuss breaking up the Eurozone, which of course will immediately kick off a full-blown currency crisis in various countries.       Interest Rates on Government Bonds Go Full Circle                 click on chart for sharper image       Chart from  Spiegel Online       When the currency crisis happens and the Eurozone breaks up as is inevitable, Europe will have gone full circle on both interest rates and currencies, with politicians chasing their tail every step of the way.

Italy is still in focus but the bloom is off the rose as reality returns. Italy\'s new leader Mario Monti is trying to put together a government and deal with what will be unpopular austerity. (You probably didn\'t know Monti is or was an advisor to Goldman Sachs. Those guys are everywhere it seems.)  Anyway, Italian bond yields climbed back toward 7% Monday. Credit Default Spreads continued to widen in the euro zone as institutional investors seek insurance from others. And, those issuing the insurance may not be good for the money should it be demanded.          The ubiquitous Warren Buffett was making the media rounds today commenting on everything from his new stake in IBM and Intel ("no, they\'re not tech companies"), prognosticating on the Republican nominee (Romney) and touting all his investments like Bank of America (BAC). Elsewhere hedge fund wunderkind David Tepper ("bad news is good, good news is better" fame) sold all his BAC stock as well as Yahoo (YHOO). Tepper had said he wasn\'t buying any stocks until the euro zone was "fixed" so perhaps he jumped the gun.

that \xe2\x80\x93 despite the false  divide-and-conquer tactics of the mainstream parties and mainstream  media \xe2\x80\x93  the overwhelming majority of Americans agree on the most important issues facing our country . See  this .    NO MORE BAILOUTS!    As I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted since  2008 , Americans are united in their overwhelming disapproval for bailouts to the big banks.    This has remained true right up to today.    As Rassmussen found only last month (as summarized by  KXLF news ):     Today\xe2\x80\x99sRasmussen Reports survey finds that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t like bailouts for financial institutions.    60% Oppose Financial Bailouts; 74% Say Wall Street Benefited Most    Survey of 1,000 American Adults    ***    \xe2\x80\xa2 Just 20% think it was a good idea  for the government to provide bailout funding to banks and other  financial institutions, but 60% say otherwise.    \xe2\x80\xa2 While many activists try to link the Republican Party and Wall Street, Republicans think the bailouts were a bad idea by an eight-to-one margin.    \xe2\x80\xa2 Those not affiliated with either major party think they were a bad  idea by a four-to-one margin. Democrats are much more evenly divided.  Thirty-four percent (34%) of those in the president\xe2\x80\x99s party say the  bailouts were a good idea while 42% disagree.    \xe2\x80\xa2 Overall, 68% believe that most of the bailout money went to the very people who created the nation\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing economic crisis, but 12% disagree and 21% aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure.     As the Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Greg Sargent  notes ,  the recent proposal from lobbyists to the American Bankers Association  recommending ways to co-opt the Occupy movement accurately stated:     Well-known Wall Street companies stand at the nexus of  where OWS protestors and the Tea Party overlap on angered populism. Both  the radical left and the radical right are channeling broader  frustration about the state of the economy and share a mutual anger over  TARP and other perceived bailouts. This combination has the potential  to be explosive later in the year when media reports cover the next  round of bonuses and contrast it with stories of millions of Americans  making do with less this holiday season.     (Except that it is the majority of Americans \xe2\x80\x93 not \xe2\x80\x9cextremists\xe2\x80\x9d on either side of the aisle \xe2\x80\x93 that share this anger).    The \xe2\x80\x9cTea Party\xe2\x80\x9d movement was centered on the protesting government bailouts of the giant banks, before it was hijacked by the mainstream Republican party, Sarah Palin, Neocons and others. See  this ,  this ,  this ,  this  and  this .    Ron Paul  said  last month at a GOP debate:     Bailouts came from both parties\xe2\x80\xa6. If you have to give  money out, you should give it to people losing their mortgages, not to  the banks.     And one of the most common sayings of Occupy Wall Street protesters is:     Banks got bailed out. We got sold out     (See  this  and  this .)    END CRONY CAPITALISM!    I  noted  last year:     A  Rassmussen poll  conducted in February found:     70% [of all voters] believe that the government and big  business typically work together in ways that hurt consumers and  investors.     (and see  this ).    Remember that the  government helped and encouraged the giant banks  to get even bigger, and then has  hidden their insolvency and s  hielded them from the free market,   and helped them grow even during the severe downturn.    In return, the big banks and giant corporations have  literally bought and paid  for the politicians.    Conservatives might call it \xe2\x80\x9csocialism\xe2\x80\x9d and liberals might call it \xe2\x80\x9cfascism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93  they are the same thing economically .    But all Americans \xe2\x80\x93 conservatives and liberals alike \xe2\x80\x93 can agree that it is not capitalism, and it is not American.     PROSECUTE WALL STREET FRAUD!    I  pointed out  a year ago:     Liberals tend to believe that the public should be  protected against harm, while conservatives tend to believe that people  should be left free to buy what they want.    Too far apart to ever agree?    No. Conservatives believe that people must be held responsible for  their actions and punished for their transgressions. Indeed, some  82%  of the American public wants tougher regulation of Wall Street.    Moreover, even for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t like the government sticking its nose in our business, liberals and conservatives agree that if a  company chooses to make a representation about something, it can be  sued if it is a lie. In other words, all Americans agree that fraud laws  should be enforced against everyone from  the homeowner who fills out a mortgage application on a small house to  the head of a giant bank who makes false statements about the bank\xe2\x80\x99s  balance sheets and the quality of it\xe2\x80\x99s investments.    Everyone agrees that financial scammers must be tried and put in prison.     Indeed, Rasmussen  found  last month:     Two-out-of-three  Americans (66%) believe the federal government has not been aggressive  enough in pursuing possible criminal behavior by some Wall Street  bankers, but 10% don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that\xe2\x80\x99s true and 25% are not sure.     Economists  agree .    END \xe2\x80\x93 OR AT LEAST REIN IN \xe2\x80\x93 THE FEDERAL RESERVE!    As I  pointed out  last month, Americans are not happy with the Federal Reserve:     CNN  notes :     \xe2\x80\x9cWe are seeing a level of enthusiasm for Ron Paul that  can be compared with President Obama in 2008\xe2\x80\xb3, said Eric Brakey, Media  Coordinator for NYC Liberty HQ, the grassroots organization hosting the  rally for the candidate. \xe2\x80\x9cCongressman Paul\xe2\x80\x99s youth support is different  now than it was during his last presidential campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s more  organized and it\xe2\x80\x99s picking up steam and continues to grow\xe2\x80\x9d.    As the longtime congressman from Texas stepped onto the stage, the crowd screamed with enthusiasm. The audience\xe2\x80\x99s biggest reaction came when he spoke about ending the Federal Reserve.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe country has changed in the last four years, but my message hasn\xe2\x80\x99t  changed\xe2\x80\x9d Paul said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe country is ripe for a true revolution\xe2\x80\x9d.     At least  75% of the American people want a full audit of the Fed , and  most were against reconfirming Bernanke .    Indeed, as Bloomberg  noted  last December:     A majority of Americans  are dissatisfied with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s independent central bank, saying the  U.S. Federal Reserve should either be brought under tighter political  control or abolished outright, a poll shows.    ***    Americans across the political spectrum say the Fed shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t retain  its current structure of independence. Asked if the central bank should  be more accountable to Congress, left independent or abolished entirely,  39 percent said it should be held more accountable and 16 percent that  it should be abolished. Only 37 percent favor the status quo.        Economists  agree .    RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LIBERTY!    As I  noted  in September, Americans want our freedom back:     Americans have become much less tolerant of the wholesale  destruction of our constitutional freedoms in the name of fighting  terrorism.    As Talking Points Memo  notes :     On the eve of the ten year anniversary of 9/11, the Pew Research Center  has released new data  on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to the attacks, and the foreign and national  security policies pursued in the post 9/11 era. They show a country with  views that have evolved on the relationship between civil liberties and  the tools given to government to fight terrorism, and a disbelief that  the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan helped to lessen the chance  there will be another terrorist attack on the United States.    The Pew survey showed a large shift in the number of Americans who  are willing to see some of their civil liberties go out the window in  the name of fighting terrorism. Directly after 9/11, Americans were  willing to make the deal, as 55 percent thought it was necessary,  against 35 percent who felt the opposite. Now, only 40 percent felt that giving up some civil liberties is necessary to curb terrorism, with 54 percent against.        END PERPETUAL WAR!    Americans want to  put a stop to perpetual warfare:      Ron Paul is [partly] gaining popularity because he is  against the never-ending War On Terror, and wants to bring the troops  home. Americans are sick of the never-ending, ever-creeping war. See  this ,  this  and  this .    As Talking Points Memo  reported  earlier this month:     \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6Only about a quarter say the wars in Iraq (26%) and  Afghanistan (25%) have lessened the chances of terrorist attacks in the  United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the Pew report reads. \xe2\x80\x9cIn both cases majorities say the  wars either have increased the risk of terrorism in this country or made  no difference.\xe2\x80\x9d     Top American military leaders agree, saying that  the war on terror has weakened our national security .     And a  CBS News poll  from November 11th  found :       Three-quarters of Americans support US withdrawal from Iraq.    Two-thirds of Americans believe the Iraq War was not worth fighting.    Half of Americans oppose US involvement in Libya.    More than half of Americans want to end the war in Afghanistan.    Seventy per cent of Americans do not support military intervention to change dictatorships into democracies.    55% of Americans say Iran can be contained via diplomacy.    Only 15% of Americans support military intervention in Iran.       MAKE ELECTIONS FAIR!    I  noted  last year that Americans want fair elections:     All Americans agree that \xe2\x80\xa6 there should be free and fair  elections. That is why \xe2\x80\x93 according to ABC News and the Washington Post \xe2\x80\x93   80 percent  of all Americans oppose the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision allowing  unlimited campaign contributions. Americans understand that \xe2\x80\x93 unless we  take the flood of money out of elections \xe2\x80\x93 Washington will represent  special interests, and not us.    And we all agree on publicly verifiable, automatically audited paper  ballot elections with reasonable ID requirements, so that we assured  that no party can manipulate electronic voting results.     KEEP POISON OUT OF OUR FOOD AND WATER!    I  noted  last year that Americans want safe food and water:     Americans want to be free to live our lives without being  poisoned. We agree on safe food, clean water and a healthy environment.    For example, polls show:       A large majority of Americans want  strong food safety rules , and  want genetically modified foods to be labeled           Most Americans are worried about  water pollution           Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be exposed to  toxic pollutants           IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE ON THESE CORE ISSUES, WHY AREN\xe2\x80\x99T OUR DEMANDS BEING HEARD?    If Americans from across the spectrum agree, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t these desires being implemented by our politicians?    Because our politicians are  bought and paid for \xe2\x80\xa6 lock, stock and barrel .    And the powers-that-be are good at using the  age-old divide and conquer  trick to keep us weak, divided and fighting at each others\xe2\x80\x99 throat \xe2\x80\xa6 instead of for what we actually want.    But ultimately, the main reason that we are impotent is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that the overwhelming majority of Americans want the same things we do.    Indeed, most Americans \xe2\x80\x93 conservatives and liberals \xe2\x80\x93 are    fed up    with  both  the mainstream Republican  and  Democratic parties. This is not surprising, given that neither party is  addressing the core demands of the American people as a whole.    Sure, liberals and conservatives will always disagree on some things.  But if we realized how many core beliefs we share, we would  unite to take our country back  from those who disagree with fundamental American values.                                                                                  \r\n')

But not necessarily for drop-ins. There is no realistic prospect for widespread electric air travel: the jet engines on aircraft need the high-energy density that only chemical fuels can provide. So if you want low-carbon flying, drop-in biofuels are the only game in town. And civil aviation alone is expected to use 250 billion litres of fuel this year, is growing fast and could pay a premium if its emissions were subject to a cap or a tax. Over the long run, the future for biofuels may be looking up.

Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s looking for business \xe2\x80\x94 even banks and credit unions     Black Friday, the quasi-official start of the holiday shopping season, has taken on a life of its own the past few years with door-buster deals, super-early openings, lines around the building, hot chocolate for diehards, \xe2\x80\x9cleaked\xe2\x80\x9d circulars weeks prior, and much more.\xc2\xa0 With the economy not really recovering with bells on, retailers are needing more than ever to capitalize on tradition.    The same is true for banks and credit unions.\xc2\xa0 Despite all of the bad press that banks have gotten for raising their fees, loans are their bread and butter.\xc2\xa0 And like retailers, they occasionally run promotions to encourage more business.\xc2\xa0 (The rate I got on  my used car loan  was a promotional rate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard to beat.)

Borrowing money to spend on holiday presents is a bit different, though.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s  so  easy to overspend during the holidays, and it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to find things that don\xe2\x80\x99t depreciate heavily after you buy them (especially from retailers).\xc2\xa0 So the $2,500 is gone, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s $217 per month for 12 months, and that lasts the whole year.\xc2\xa0 (A lot of the presents bought with that money have probably worn out their welcome by March at the latest \xe2\x80\x94 maybe New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve?)    Everyone wants to sell you a bargain.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a good deal for the person selling you the bargain, especially this time of year.

The GOP members, of course, are casting it as a Dem problem. For example, Hensarling (a very far right member of the group, from Texas) blamed the Dems for not accepting the Toomey proposal for a piddling $300 billion in new tax revenue.\xc2\xa0  With Supercommittee Deadlocked, leaders Reid and Boehner meet .     The across-the-board cuts would cut Defense by $500 billion.\xc2\xa0 Various GOP members of Congress have said they want to change the deal to avoid the cuts to the military.\xc2\xa0 Tea Party favorite and radical right-winger Jim DeMint has essentially admitted that he never intended to stick with the sequester deal, saying that the GOP has "until next election to fix this thing."\xc2\xa0 GOP stalwarts want the US to maintain its exorbitant spending as "the world\'s only military superpower" even while being willing to cut health care and pensions to the vulnerable and even while the country\'s infrastructure--essential for business--crumbles in ruins.\xc2\xa0 McCain and Graham urged the Senate to reject the sequester of military funds, fearful it would "set off a swift decline of the United States as the world\'s leading military power."  Dems gain upper hand in deficit talks , The Hill (Nov. 16, 2011).\xc2\xa0    This attitude seems to believe that defense spending, no matter what the cost to the country, is okay, while spending on poor people is a waste and raising taxes on the rich is an impossibility.\xc2\xa0 Apparently GOP McKeon considered that possibility, but then later backtracked.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, Grover Norquist has been making sure the pressure is on from the corporate masters of our pseudo-democracy--the Hill notes Norquist\'s statement Monday that both Senate and House GOP leaders had "assured him they would not raise taxes to reduce the deficit."\xc2\xa0 Id.    So we have elected representatives in Congress who willfully ignore the will of the majority of people in favor of higher taxes and higher taxes on the rich and corporations in particular; ignore the facts that show that higher taxes on the rich and a more equal economy are better for everybody; and ignore the fact that their own policies (preemptive war and tax cuts during deficits from 2001-2008 under Bush) represent the substantial reason for long-term deficits--all in order to continue to support extraordinarily disproportionate spending on the military rather than on public infrastructure, education and health and in order to be able to continue to use the self-created "debt crisis" to push for further impoverization of America\'s middle class.\xc2\xa0 What a backwards value system that represents can\'t be expressed in a public blog.    But at least Reid has said that method of reneging on the agreement won\'t be allowed to happen: "Democrats aren\'t going to take an unfair, unrealistic load directed toward domestic discretionary spending and take it away from the military."\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See Id.; see also  Reid: Dems will oppose efforts to spare Defense from automatic cuts , The Hil (Nov. 14, 2011).    As one of the commenters on The Hill notes (quoting an NPR program), the supercommittee is set up to force one of two bad choices--reducing the social safety net or cutbacks during economic recession.\xc2\xa0 What we should be doing is increasing taxes now on the rich and on corporations, and then allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of next year--in their entirety.\xc2\xa0 We should make judicious spending cuts in wasteful programs--and the military certainly should be a target of some of those cuts.\xc2\xa0 And we should make judicious spending increases in infrastructure, research and educational support programs to add stimulus to keep the economy going.    Case in point--the New York Times story today about a small town in Kentucky that decided to increase taxes to pay for infrastructure improvements that are putting the two back on the map.    originally published at\xc2\xa0  ataxingmatter        \r\n')

The paper has a look at climate data to date and the methodological limitations that have given rise to what Richard Muller, an astrophysicist, characterise as "legitimate scepticism". As the article explains, Dr Muller, being somewhat sceptical himself in the wake of the 2009 "Climategate" scandal, convened the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group to examine the data and existing analyses using a methodology designed to incorporate some of the concerns of the legitimate sceptics. On October 20th, the group released four papers that corroborate the climate consensus: "The group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911\xc2\xb0C: a mere 2% less than NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s estimate."The corroboration should comfort people who are concerned about climate change, although the data are not comforting in the grand scheme of things. No doubt a lot of climate sceptics are stubborn and will not be moved by new methodological approaches. Some, however, will. And although American environmentalists are regrouping after a series of setbacks, they\'re hardly going to abandon the issue of climate change.

In the US, the winds of Washington Politics don\'t blow, they suck.    Gerrymandering the Jobs Bill :       " The piece of the jobs bill Republicans will pass would end a requirement that the government withhold three percent of the cost of projects contracted out to private companies, to assure tax compliance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rule that Congress adopted during the Bush administration to cut down on tax cheating by government contractors."         The proposals would incorporate a permanent repeal of the withholding which today saves $10 billion in lost taxes. To counter the revenue loss the Republicans have a solution (as paid for by Medicaid/SS recipients):          "all legislation other than permanent tax cuts for wealthy people must be paid for \xe2\x80\x94 typically with cuts to federal programs. So Republicans have selected a provision from Obama\xe2\x80\x99s deficit reduction recommendations that would limit Medicaid eligibility for people who also receive Social Security benefits.        A concept called Modified Adjusted Gross Income is used to determine Medicaid eligibility. Currently, it only incorporates the taxable portion of Social Security income in that calculation. Under t a new proposal, it would factor in all Social Security benefits. That means some seniors who currently qualify for Medicaid would no longer be eligible. Doing this would save about $14.6 billion over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 more than the cost of repealing the 3 percent withholding compliance measure."  GOP Lays Trap for Obama on Jobs Bill"           Finance the tax cheats and sacrifice Medicaid and SS recipients.     Watching Your Back???     In Order to open negotiations with the Repubs, the Dems on the Super Committee       "are offering to cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits as part of a roughly $3 trillion grand bargain, which would well exceed the $1.2 trillion minimum goal the committee is tasked with meeting.      The Democratic plan proposes cutting the deficit by $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion and calls for between $200 billion and $300 billion in new stimulus spending to boost an ailing U.S. economy. It would be paid for with lower interest payments from reducing deficits.      It also seeks around $400 billion in Medicare savings, with half coming in benefit cuts and the other half in cuts to healthcare providers. Details of that proposal were scant but tackling the popular Medicare program is always politically risky for politicians in Washington, especially Democrats.      The Democratic proposal also identifies $100 billion in cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor, according to a lobbyist in contact with the committee."    Dems Seek $3trillion in Savings           Fortunately, The Repubs would not accept a tax increase on the income rich even with throwing Grandmother under the bus to finance it . . .     The Party of "No"rquist     It appears that many of the signers of the pledge representing "No"rquist beliefs and the Repub party over the constituency which elected them have feet made of sand as the currents of public anger are over whelming the views proffered.      " ATR currently has signatures from 238 House representatives, 41 Senators, 13 governors, and all of the GOP presidential candidates except former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman."         Anti-Tax Crusader Grover Norquist\xe2\x80\x99s Grip is Slipping       Who elected these turkeys??? Hmmm, that\'s right, we did and the views they are espousing? Even that ever lovable former Senator from that wilderness state west of the Hudson Wyoming is calling for a resistance to outside influence (ATR) which has no impact on getting elected again. And Senator Coburn challenged Norquist on Ethanol subsidies? Such bravado . . .         \xe2\x80\x9cHave we really reached a point where one person\xe2\x80\x99s demand for ideological purity is paralyzing Congress to the point that even a discussion of tax reform is viewed as breaking a no-tax pledge? \xe2\x80\x9d Senator Wolf asked.      And the man with the perpetual sun tan Boehner asked of Norquist\'s relevance.           "some random guy,       Grover told me that he saw himself as the Lenin of the conservative revolution and that Ralph Reed was his Trotsky and Jack Abramoff was his Stalin.\xe2\x80\x9d           As  Oliver Wight used to say "Cement heads!" Someone has sounded the "abandon ship"  alert as the Repub-titanic has struck the iceberg of public dissent. Maybe  Occupy America has struck a nerve? It doesn\'t take a weatherman . . . We will  make the same mistake again and re-elect these turkeys.       \r\n')

matter how many times it is spelled out. The horrendous "eurobond" idea simply will not go away, even though Merkel and the German supreme court buried it long ago.      Even if Merkel was willing to give in on the idea, Finland and Austria wouldn\'t, and more importantly neither would the German supreme court.      Yet people keep wasting time debating the merits of it. It\'s like debating the merits of perpetual motion. No matter what the merits might be, perpetual motion is not going to happen, so there is no point in debating it.       Run on the Eurozone has Started       Eurointelligence proclaims  Run on the Eurozone has Started     Jose Manuel Barroso warned yesterday the euro would be \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult or impossible\xe2\x80\x9d to sustain without further economic integration. German newspapers this morning produced a whole string of poisonous comments about the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for Eurobonds. The eurozone is now in a position where crisis resolution requires a much firmer political commitment than member states had expected to provide.       German could accept Eurobonds under certain conditions           Taken at face value the German opposition against Eurobonds seems to  be as strong as ever and most German papers such as S\xc3\xbcddeutsche Zeitung  and Handelsblatt report on the topic in these terms. Nevertheless, the  resistance against the Commission is less categorical than it appears,  Financial Times Deutschland   writes. Angela Merkel did not rule out Eurobonds but rather said the  timing of Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Barroso\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d. Among the  condition she enumerated were changes of the EU treaties and a much  stronger commitment of member states to condolidate. Norbert Barthle,  the budgetary spokesperson of Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s CDU/CSU parliamentary group, told  FTD: \xe2\x80\x9cWe never say never. All we say is: no Eurobonds under current  conditions\xe2\x80\x9d. As a result there is scope for a deal at the EU summit  December 9. The idea is preposterous. There is no scope for a deal and no time for a deal even if there was scope. Moreover, and even if there was scope and time, it would require a German referendum and treaty changes by all 17 Eurozone countries.      Facts do not stop politicians or writers.        Hitler Enters the Equation        Writer Mark Schieritz in  Nazi Adolf, inflation and the euro crisis  blames the rise of Hitler on the gold standard and deflation.     The  hyperinflation of the twenties led to so that the Weimar Republic was  entirely prescribed a hard currency strategy - regardless of losses.  Others were wiser because:       After  leaving the gold standard, the UK saw its unemployment rate decline by  about a third from 1931 to 1933, while Germany\'s rose over the same  period Significantly.   If  Germany had been willing to follow the UK in inflating, and its  unemployment rate had followed a similar trajectory, it would have stood  at 17% rather than 33%.       In other words, perhaps the greatest catastrophe in human history could  have been prevented if the Germans had allowed a little more inflation.      The euro in its present form is in many ways comparable to the gold standard.  The cause of the great depression was the runup in credit that preceded it. Blaming gold for the rise of Hitler or for the great depression is preposterous. Begging for inflation is equally preposterous.      Economies go through these massive boom-bust cycles because of inflation, fractional reserve lending, and rampant credit expansion. The cure cannot be the same as the disease no matter how one tries to distort the facts with untenable correlations.      Central banks, governments, fiat currencies, and fractional reserve lending are responsible for every major economic bust in history and fools come back begging for more.       Enough! Eurobonds are not going to happen (nor should they happen).      For a detailed discussion of why Eurobonds and ECB printing are piss poor ideas,  please see  Understanding the Problem, Understanding the Solution, and Understanding Who is to Blame are Three Different Things .      I wrote that last evening but failed to post it. At the time US futures were up over 1%. Now I see they were flat. The reason? I presume this:       Merkel Reiterates the Obvious       Bloomberg reports  European Stocks, Euro Fall on Merkel Comments     The euro weakened, Italian bonds declined and the cost of insuring European government against default rose to a record after German Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled out joint euro-area borrowing. European stocks fluctuated.       Euro bonds are \xe2\x80\x9cnot needed and not appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d Merkel said at a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Strasbourg, France.      \xe2\x80\x9cThe market sees a \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 and reacts to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Huefner, chief economist at Assenagon GmbH in Munich, which manages more than $4.7 billion of client assets. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a deterioration of equity markets in the coming months to the point where something will have to be done. The market would be euphoric to get euro bonds. Apparently the pressure is not big enough yet.\xe2\x80\x9d   No Hope or Future for Eurobonds       Huefner has it backwards. The market hears "yes" and reacts to it, even when it is damn obvious the answer is no.      There is no hope or future for Eurobonds and there never was.       No matter how many times this is explained or reiterated, some eurocratic fool or some fool writer finds some lame excuse to attempt to revive the dead. The latest (yesterday) was preposterous analysis by the Financial Times suggesting Merkel did not "really" mean no. This was followed up with the ludicrous idea by Mark Schieritz who blamed gold and  lack of inflation  for the rise of Hitler.      Sheeesh.       Now that Eurobonds are finally dead (hopefully), can we please start a rational discussion as to how best to break up the Eurozone?

While they plan to open their doors early on Black Friday like other retailers, these big box stores have already started their sales events including substantial discounts on new appliances that&#8217;ll ease your holiday cooking and cleaning up. We saw prices slashed on some of the refrigerators, dishwashers, cooking appliances and laundry equipment that Consumer Reports recommends as well as discounts on models we didn&#8217;t like so much.      &#8220;It&#8217;s a great time of year to shop for appliances because our suppliers give us a lot of special offers that save our customers money,&#8221; said Bob Baird, merchandising vice president for appliances at Home Depot, adding that some consumers take advantage of the deals to upgrade their kitchens for holiday entertaining while others see the purchase "as a gift for the entire family.&#8221; Below are some of the deals we found at Home Depot, Lowe\'s and Sears on models tested by Consumer Reports. The list is not exhaustive so check the retailer\'s website for more information. All prices were current at press time.        Home Depot     Home Depot is offering up to  40 percent off select appliances  through November 28 while supplies last. The retailer is also offering discounts on kitchen suites by LG, GE and Maytag and washer/dryer combos by LG, GE, Maytag and Admiral as well as 20 percent off Dyson vacuum cleaners. Delivery is free and Home Depot will haul away your old appliances. Here are some models to consider and others to avoid.       Refrigerators.  The  Maytag MFX2571XE[W]  French-door bottom-freezer refrigerator, a recommended model, has been marked down from $2,699 to $1,798. Another recommended refrigerator, the top-freezer  LG LTC22350[SW]  was originally $999 and is now $798. But the  GE Profile PGSS5RKZ[SS]  French-door bottom-freezer model only scored 35 (out of 100) in our Ratings so the markdown from $2,599 to $1,798 may not be such a great buy.       Ranges.   LG&#8217;s LDE3015ST  electric range scored a respectable 81 in our Ratings but did not make the recommended list. Originally $1,199, it is now $898. At less than $700&#8212;marked down from $850&#8212; Maytag&#8217;s MER7765W[W]  is affordable but with a score of 69 it landed in the middle of the pack.       Dishwashers.  Two dishwashers with middling scores are also being discounted. The  GE GLD5766V[SS] , which scored a 58, has been marked down from $550 to $400. And the  LG LDF6920[WW] , which with a score of 79 did a little better, has been discounted from $799 to $598.         Lowe&#8217;s     At Lowe&#8217;s consumers who buy a Samsung kitchen suite can save up to $1,200 with combined discounts. And matching washer and dryer sets from Samsung  and Whirlpool are being marked down as much as $1,100. Select refrigerators are being  discounted by 40 percent  and you can save up to 45 percent on a Samsung over-the-range microwave. But take note, not everything is a bargain.       Refrigerators.  The price of the  Samsung RF4287HA[RS]   French-door bottom-freezer refrigerator, a model we recommend, has been dropped from $2,999 to $1,799.

  In his article he chastises Germany for its role in the Eurozone mess, citing Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Wolfgang Schauble and the northern neo-Calvinists. Pritchard also praises a report by Simon Tilford and Philip Whyte on how  stricter rules threaten the eurozone .      There is certainly much in the report that I agree with, primarily a description of the problem. Unfortunately, there is even more I disagree with, notably the solution.      Ideas I agree with:        Creditor countries cannot be absolved of all blame.    If the eurozone had been a fully-fledged fiscal union, it would not be in its  current  predicament. (Mish: It would be a  different  predicament, likely much worse)    The current crisis is not simply a tale of fiscal irresponsibility and lost competitiveness in the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s geographical periphery. It is also about the unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances to which the launch of the euro contributed (in creditor and debtor countries)    The challenges presented by Greece were always going to be daunting, given the dysfunctional nature of its political economy.    The medicine prescribed to Greece \xe2\x80\x93 which was partly motivated by an urge to punish it and to take a stand against moral hazard \xe2\x80\x93 was doomed to failure.    A year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of punishing austerity and contracting activity has only succeeded in pushing Greece deeper into insolvency.    The eurozone will not emerge from the debt crisis without economic growth.    It is now clear that a currency shared by fiscally sovereign member states is more vulnerable to losses of confidence than a monetary union that is more fully integrated.    A familiar pattern has now set in. Under market duress, leaders hold an emergency summit and announce an agreement designed to restore confidence once and for all.    After an initial bout of euphoria, financial markets digest the contents of the agreement, conclude that it does not resolve the underlying problems, and the cycle starts all over again. Each agreement buys less time and the stakes become larger with every summit.       Hopefully we can all agree on those 10 points. The problem is the Euro was fatally flawed from the beginning.       No in Many Languages       No currency union has ever survived without there being a fiscal union at the same time. Is Germany to blame for this?      I say Nein, Non, Ochi, Iie, Nie, Nej, and of course No.       Who is to Blame?       The rules of the Maastricht Treaty were known by everyone at the outset and there were many architects of the Euro idea including Jean-Claude Trichet. In that regard it makes as much sense to blame France as it does Germany.       Moreover, countries could have accepted or rejected the treaty. Every country had a vote (or many votes - as politicians crammed the Euro down their citizens\' throats whether they wanted it or not).      The UK chose wisely, other countries did not, including Germany. Every country stupid enough to enter this untenable arrangement can look in the mirror and blame themselves.       The Non-Solutions       Unfortunately, the rest of the report borders on the nonsensical, notably " All eurozone countries should therefore finance debt by issuing bonds which would be jointly guaranteed by all of them. "      The authors then proceed to discuss all the inherent problems with the idea including " moral hazards ", borrowing targets, etc, stating " A dogmatic target of budgetary balance four years hence, irrespective of a country\xe2\x80\x99s position in the economic cycle, would achieve little. "       The authors then have to figure out a way around dogmatic targets, proposing " rules should be set with reference to the cyclically-adjusted fiscal position for each member state. "      That of course creates another problem as to how to do that, coming to the conclusion that 17 votes is too many, and a creditor-dominated board would not work, but " A board of nine economists, from the big eurozone economies, the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the OECD  might  form a good basis. "      Good grief.         Wait, I am not done yet. The authors freely admit " the issuance of eurobonds will not prevent debt crises in the absence of steps to reduce trade imbalances within the eurozone "  then attempt to dream up solutions to that problem.      That idea makes as much sense as attempting to solve a trade disparity between California and Indiana.         We are still not done yet. The authors see a need to " set up a jointly-funded, eurozone-wide deposit protection scheme. "      Finally, the authors conclude " The ECB\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is too restrictive. The central bank must guard against excessive inflation. But its fear of inflation blinds it to the much more serious threats confronting the eurozone economy. "      Apparently Europe needs a "mandate" but one that is meaningless, and allows the central bank to print at will.       Conclusion          The authors ramble on about various problems, real and imagined, then conclude with ...    Eurozone leaders now face a choice between two unpalatable alternatives. Either they accept that the eurozone is institutionally flawed and do what is necessary to turn it into a more stable arrangement. This will require some of them to go beyond what their voters seem prepared to allow, and to accept that a certain amount of \xe2\x80\x98rule-breaking\xe2\x80\x99 is necessary in the short term if the eurozone is to survive intact. Or they can stick to the fiction that confidence can be restored by the adoption (and enforcement) of tougher rules. This option will condemn the eurozone to self-defeating policies that hasten defaults, contagion and eventual break-up.  Indeed, Not       Pritchard, cited the above paragraph and finished with "Indeed. Read it all"      I did read it all and nearly threw up at the self-serving myth there are only two options.        Break the rules    Stick to self-defeating policies        There is a third option and Pritchard should know it well: Plan for a breakup of the Eurozone and make banks write down bad investments. Bondholders will take a hit, but they deserve to. It is time to stop bailing out banks at the expense of taxpayers.      The report by Simon Tilford and Philip Whyte with all their convoluted solutions culminating in the creation of a "fiscal nanny-zone" should be enough to convince anyone the Euro is not worth saving.      Countries that disagree can keep the damn thing. If France wants a fiscal nanny-state and unlimited printing by the ECB, fine. Let France have it.       True Solution        The best solution and the one I propose is for Germany to leave the Eurozone. I am quite sure other countries in Northern Europe would follow. The Euro will still survive in my proposal, and France can be king of the nanny-hill if it elects to stay in.      Yes this would be disruptive. However, it would give the Euro-fools what they want and Northern European voters (not politicians) what they want.      Michael Pettis outlined a compelling case why Germany exiting the Eurozone is the best option. Please see  Eurozone Breakup Logistics (Never Believe Anything Until It\'s Officially Denied)  for details.       The Euroskeptics Were Right        The Euroskeptics were right, straight from the beginning. Pritchard was among those skeptics. He was right then. He was also correct in a major way when he stated the German supreme court would not allow Eurobonds or ECB printing.      Please see  Germany\'s    Top Judge Throws Major Monkey Wrench Into Leveraged EFSF Machinery,    Demands New Constitution and Popular Referendum for Further Powers  for details.      Unfortunately he is wrong now. In more ways than one.        Pritchard is wrong on who to blame    Pritchard is wrong to perpetrate the myth the euro can be saved     Pritchard is wrong about fearing deflation (a natural state of affairs actually, it is only fractional reserve lending and mountains of debt that bring upon such fears. The solution is to get rid of central bankers and end fractional reserve lending)    Pritchard is wrong to not fear inflation in the scenario proposed by Tilford and Whyte.         Eurobond, Unlimited Printing Foolishness       I am not the only one who thinks the eurobond, unlimited printing idea is beyond foolish. John Hussman had an excellent writeup on Monday  Why the ECB Won\'t (and Shouldn\'t) Just Print     Over the past week, we\'ve heard all sorts of propositions that the European Central Bank (ECB) "must" begin printing money to bail out Italy and other countries, because "there is no other option." There are three basic difficulties with this idea.      The first is that ECB buying might help to address immediate liquidity issues of distressed European countries, but it would not address long-term solvency issues, and would in fact make them worse.      The second is that the ECB, under existing European treaties, has no such authority, and the prohibitions against it are very explicit. Changing that would be far more difficult than many market participants seem to believe, because it would require an explicit and unanimous change in the EU Treaties that AAA rated countries such as Germany and Finland vehemently oppose.       The third difficulty is that even if the ECB was to buy the debt of distressed European countries with printed money, the inflationary effects would likely be far more swift than anything we\'ve seen in the United States. This would not "save" the euro, but would simply destroy it by other means .  Hussman builds an excellent case.      I will conclude the way Pritchard did: "Indeed. Read it all".

Online crooks, like their real-world brethren, do not file quarterly reports. In the absence of figures from the practitioners, experts tend to fall back on surveys of victims, often compiled by firms that sell security software. These have a whiff of self interest about them: they are the kind of studies that get press released but not peer reviewed.A paper by two researchers at Microsoft, Dinei Florencio and Cormac Herley, shows why: because losses are unevenly distributed. Most people never have their bank accounts raided by cyber criminals, but an unfortunate few do, and lose a lot. This means that per capita losses, which the surveys calculate before extrapolating to a national figure, are dominated by a handful of big online heists. Errors in the reporting of such infrequent crimes have a huge effect on the headline figure. In a 1,000-person survey in America, for example, exaggerating the impact of a single crime by $50,000 would add $10 billion to the national figure.Other data can be skewed this way too.

The moves follow the FCC\'s decision to hold an administrative hearing on the merger, which has hit opposition on grounds that it would hurt competition in the U.S. wireless-phone sector. The $39 billion cash-and-stock deal was announced last March. The companies said they would seek antitrust clearance through their current litigation in U.S. District Court in Washington or through other means. "As soon as practical," the companies "intend to seek the necessary FCC approval," they said.  Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Why are rates going further in the basement?\xc2\xa0 A few reasons:        It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to find qualifying borrowers.\xc2\xa0  A lot of people are living  life after foreclosure  and just flat-out don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for a mortgage, let alone a mortgage at the best rates available.     Banks are lending less.\xc2\xa0  This is related to the search for qualifying borrowers, but from the supply side of the equation.\xc2\xa0 Banks on the whole are gun-shy after the bath that they took when housing crashed.     The economy is still below par.\xc2\xa0  Unemployment is still north of 9%.\xc2\xa0 It was under 5% four years ago.       Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that I got a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage five years ago, when the rate was about 6.25%.\xc2\xa0 On a $150,000 loan, my payment would have been $923.58.\xc2\xa0 After five years I\xe2\x80\x99d owe almost exactly $140,000.    If I refinanced the remaining $140,000 at a 15-year  fixed rate mortgage  of 3% \xe2\x80\x94 which is the going rate! \xe2\x80\x94  my payment would go up only by $43 per month, and I\xe2\x80\x99d shave a full ten years off of my mortgage.     I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think rates would get still better from this year\xe2\x80\x99s lows, but I was wrong.\xc2\xa0 If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t refinanced in a while and your credit is sparkly-shiny, run some numbers and give it some serious thought.\xc2\xa0 These are crazy  low mortgage rates .

According to the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization, Americans generate an extra 5 million tons of household waste each year between Thanksgiving and New Year's.       To reduce the amount of food that gets thrown out, you can plan for how much  you\xe2\x80\x99ll need before you start cooking, and also control portion size during the meal. Plus you can make the most of the leftovers once the holiday feast is at an end.       Steps to curb food waste from the Worldwatch Institute:      Plan how much food you and your guests will realistically need. The fear of not providing enough to eat often causes hosts to cook too much.    Create a shopping list and stick to it. This can reduce the risk of impulse buys, or buying too much of one thing.     Reduce the amount left on plates. The holiday season often promotes plates piled high with food. You can use smaller serving utensils or plates to encourage smaller portions, and guests can always take seconds.     Allow guests to serve themselves, choosing what, and how much, they would like to eat. This also helps reduce the amount of unwanted food left on plates.    Store leftovers properly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that hot foods be left out for no more than two hours. Store leftovers in smaller, individually sized containers, making them more convenient to grab for a quick meal.    Consider composting scraps of food. Individual composting systems can be relatively easy and inexpensive, and compost can do wonders for garden soil.    If composting is not an option, look into creative new recipes for leftovers. For example, vegetable scraps and turkey carcasses can be boiled down for stock and soups, and bread crusts can be used for croutons.    Donate holiday meal excess. To find a food bank near you, visit the organization\xe2\x80\x99s Food Bank Locator.    Support food-recovery programs. In some cases, food-recovery systems will come to you to collect your excess. In New York City, City Harvest collects about 28 million pounds of food each year, providing groceries and meals for over 300,000 people, the Worldwatch Institute reports.     Think carefully about giving food items as holiday gifts. Avoid perishable items, and select foods that you know the recipient will enjoy. For example, chocolate, coffee, and tea all  have long shelf lives.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s lesson talked about racking up lots of credit card debt and expecting others to take care of you. (Oh wait \xe2\x80\xa6 sorry \xe2\x80\xa6 that was the pamphlet I saw for FROWN Ministries.) But seriously    today\xe2\x80\x99s lesson discussed saving and investing, compound interest \xe2\x80\xa6 all of that good stuff.    One of the key ideas associated with compound interest is that it\xe2\x80\x99s magic. I guess most people that talk about compound interest assume that the people listening think that math is boring, and that\xe2\x80\x99s probably true. But the key ingredient to make the magic work is time. Decades worth of time, usually.    The lesson not only drove home that regular investment a good thing, but at the time it also seemed to suggest that wanting to do it any way but slowly and methodically was not a good thing. Enter Proverbs 28:20:      A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. (Proverbs 28:20, NIV)      This statement concerned me a little because (a) I do often think about different ways to make money that are faster than compounding interest, and (b) I want to enjoy the fruits before they have to be put through a food processor and spoon-fed to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m reading through MJ DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s   The Millionaire Fastlane   and he refers to this slow, systematic retirement plan as, well, the \xe2\x80\x9cslow lane.\xe2\x80\x9d Does the desire to kick things into high gear make me \xe2\x80\x9ceager to get rich\xe2\x80\x9d as stated in Proverbs 28:20?     It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of balance and honesty     John Gill, an English theologian in the late-17th, early 18th-century, had this to say about the phrase:      \xe2\x80\xa6 but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent; he that is over anxious, and immoderately desirous of being rich, and pursues every method of obtaining his desires, with all his might and main; that labours night and day for it; though he takes no criminal nor unlawful methods, properly so called, nor does he do anything injurious to others, yet he is not innocent; that too much anxiety in him is criminal; nor is he free from covetousness; and if he uses any unjust and unlawful means to acquire wealth, and resolves to be rich, right or wrong \xe2\x80\xa6 he shall not be innocent, neither before God nor men \xe2\x80\xa6.\xc2\xa0 ( reference )      There are many godly rich men mentioned in the Bible: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, Barnabus, and Job, to name a few. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ungodly to be rich. Nor is it ungodly to become rich at a young age, if the person\xe2\x80\x99s heart is in the right place. Being hell-bent on becoming rich, though, is the problem, and this is the notion that is connected with the word \xe2\x80\x9ceager.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not the desire to be smart about making money to bring it in faster that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s both the manner in which it\xe2\x80\x99s done, and also whether more important things are sacrificed in the process.    So the takeaway for me is that wanting to get rich on an accelerated schedule isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cbeing eager to get rich,\xe2\x80\x9d but it can be, and I have to ask continually for wisdom as to whether I\xe2\x80\x99m following the good path or one of the many bad ones.

'   The UK had been expected to have a voter referendum on proposed EU treaty changes. The EU of course does not want voter referendums or anything that look remotely democratic as we have seen by actions in Greece and Italy.        Deal or No Deal?       The problem for the EU is all 27 nations have to agree to treaty changes or it\'s no deal. A political work-around is in progress (as always).  And Merkel will allegedly give up on the Financial Transaction Tax idea if only Cameron will sign on the bottom line.       Piss Poor Deal       It\'s a piss poor deal and Cameron should know it. Once the EU gets what they want, Sarkozy and Merkel and others will be back at it, demanding once again the financial transaction tax and God only knows what else.       Secret Plans to Derail Referendum       The Telegraph notes  Germany\'s secret plans to derail a British referendum on the EU     Germany has drawn up secret plans to prevent a British referendum on the overhaul of the European Union amid concerns it could derail the eurozone rescue package, leaked documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph disclose.       Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is today expected to tell David Cameron that Britain does not need a referendum on EU treaty changes, despite demands from senior Conservatives for more powers to be repatriated to Britain.      The leaked memo, written by the German foreign office, discloses radical plans for an intrusive new European body that will be able to take over the economies of beleaguered eurozone countries.      It discloses that the EU\xe2\x80\x99s largest economy is also preparing for other European countries, which are too large to be bailed out, to default on their debts \xe2\x80\x94 effectively going bankrupt. It will prompt fears that German plans to deal with the eurozone crisis involve an erosion of national sovereignty that could pave the way for a European \xe2\x80\x9csuper state\xe2\x80\x9d with its own tax and spending plans set in Brussels.      Britain would be relegated to a new outer group of EU members who are not in the single currency. Mr Cameron will today travel to Brussels and Berlin for tense negotiations with Mrs Merkel amid growing disagreement between the leaders over how to deal with the eurozone.       The six-page German foreign ministry paper sets out plans for the creation of a European Monetary Fund with a transfer of sovereignty away from member states.      The fund will have the power to take ailing countries into receivership and run their economies. Even more controversially, the document, entitled The future of the EU: required integration policy improvements for the creation of a Stability Union, declares that the treaty changes are a first stage \xe2\x80\x9cin which the EU will develop into a political union\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cThe debate on the way towards a political union must begin as soon as the course toward stability union is charted,\xe2\x80\x9d it concludes.      The negotiating document also explicitly examines ways to limit treaty changes to speed up the reforms. It indicates that Mrs Merkel will tell Mr Cameron to rule out a popular EU vote in Britain.      \xe2\x80\x9cLimiting the effect of the treaty changes to the eurozone states would make ratification easier, which would nevertheless be required by all EU member states (thereby less referenda could be necessary, which could also affect the UK),\xe2\x80\x9d read the paper.       Open Europe, a think tank, last night called for Mr Cameron to demand something in return from Mrs Merkel for her \xe2\x80\x9cfar-reaching plan\xe2\x80\x9d, which requires the unanimous consent of all 27 EU countries, giving Britain a veto.      \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be the first step towards a vision of \'political union\xe2\x80\x99 that would have major consequences for the future of the entire EU, and therefore the UK\xe2\x80\x99s place within it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen Booth, the think tank\'s research director.      "Merkel is daring Cameron to call her bluff, but if the UK is serious about taking a leadership role in shaping the EU, Cameron will have to take a stand sooner rather than later."      Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, accused the Coalition of standing by in "no\xe2\x80\x93man\'s land" while Germany shaped the EU to suit its own interests.      "We are going to get nothing significant in return for agreeing to this," he said.      Mr Cameron is today also expected to pressurise Mrs Merkel into lifting German opposition to the use of the European Central Bank to rescue the euro.   Two-Speed Europe and the Clutches of France       The Guardian reports  Cameron warned his eurozone stance risks forcing two-speed Europe        David Cameron will be warned that he risks creating an unstoppable momentum behind a "two-speed Europe", which would be dominated by France and Germany, if Britain demands too many concessions during the eurozone crisis.      In a series of meetings in Berlin and Brussels, the prime minister will be advised that Britain should table modest proposals next year when EU leaders embark on a small treaty revision to underpin the euro.      A six-page German foreign ministry paper, published by Der Spiegel this week, calls for "a (\'small\') convention that is precisely limited in terms of content" to present proposals "rapidly". These would then be agreed by all 27 members of the EU.      Merkel warned the prime minister at an emergency European council meeting in Brussels on 23 October that she would reluctantly have to side with France if Britain overplayed its hand in the negotiations. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, wants a treaty to be agreed among the 17 members of the eurozone, excluding Britain and the other nine EU members outside the single currency.      This would be seen as a major step towards the formalisation of a "two-speed Europe" in which France, Germany and the four other triple A-rated eurozone members would form an inner core. Britain and Denmark, the only two members of the EU with a legal opt-out from the euro, would form the backbone of an outer core.      One Brussels diplomat said: "There is a choice the UK has to make. Does it push Germany into the clutches of France or does it try to find an accommodation with the Germans by not going too far in its demands on repatriating powers? The Germans want to find an accommodation with the British but they must not go too far." Got that? Cameron is supposed to accept a bad deal from Merkel, or Germany will make an even worse deal with France.       German Finance Minister Says UK will Join the Euro       Talk like this should scare the hell out of the UK citizens:  Britain will have to join the euro, says Tory grandee Lord Heseltine     Britain will soon have no choice but to join the euro, Tory grandee Lord Heseltine has claimed, as tensions grow over the eurozone\'s slow-moving efforts to get a grip on the spreading debt crisis.       The former deputy prime minister, a long-time supporter of the single currency, said the public had "no idea" about the potential impact its collapse would have on the UK.      But he believes Franco-German determination will secure the euro\'s future and pave the way for Britain to sign up.      Both the Coalition and the Labour Party have ruled out adopting the euro in the foreseeable future.      Last month Prime Minister David Cameron suffered the biggest ever Conservative revolt over Europe as more than 80 Conservative MPs defied his orders and backed a referendum on Britain\xe2\x80\x99s membership of the European Union.      German Finance Minister Says UK will Join Euro       Please consider  Britain \'will join euro before long\xe2\x80\x99, says German finance minister     Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble said that, despite the current crisis in the eurozone, the euro will ultimately emerge as the common currency of the entire European Union. He said he \xe2\x80\x9crespects\xe2\x80\x9d Britain\xe2\x80\x99s decision to keep the pound, but insisted that the survival and eventual stabilisation of the euro will convince non-members to join the currency club. \xe2\x80\x9cThis may happen more quickly than some people in the British Isles currently believe,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.      Mr Sch\xc3\xa4uble also said Germany will stand firm on its call for a financial transaction tax that Britain believes would badly harm the City of London.       Sir John Major, the former prime minister, warned last night that the growing integration of the eurozone nations threatens democracy in those countries. He told Al Jazeera television that richer euro members led by Germany and France will \xe2\x80\x9cinsist on moving towards what we call fiscal union. By that I mean common control over budgets and fiscal deficits\xe2\x80\x9d.       Sir John, who advises David Cameron on foreign policy issues, also described the banking transaction tax as \xe2\x80\x9ca heat-seeking missile proposed in continental Europe, aimed at the City of London\xe2\x80\x9d.   Promises on Transaction Tax will not be Kept       The arrogant talk by Sch\xc3\xa4uble in and of itself should be enough to convince Cameron that the financial transaction tax talk will never go away and that no deal with Merkel can be trusted.      Thus, Cameron should not agree to any treaty changes except those for the explicit purpose of creating exit procedure for countries to leave the Euro.       The Eurozone is about to break up yet Merkel, Sch\xc3\xa4uble, Sarkozy and others still cling to failed ideas. Pressure on the UK is nothing but last minute sheer desperation by those attempting to bully the UK into accepting the creation of a nanny-zone super state.      The irony is both Cameron and Merkel want something that is blatantly stupid. Cameron wants the ECB to buy bonds on a massive scale, while Merkel wants the financial transaction tax and a nanny-zone super state. All three ideas are horrendous.      Should Cameron get sucked into a lousy deal (which means virtually any deal Merkel will offer), all Cameron would accomplish would be to prolong the agony.      Enough is enough, Cameron should tell Merkel "No Deal", which of course is the polite way of saying "Go to Hell".

0.32490734542214295, '   by  Mike Kimel    Scott Sumner Digs Deeper   Scott Sumner  criticizes  my most recent post in which I indicate that Keynesian theory explains growth rates during the New Deal era better than theories proposed by monetarists.  He starts by criticizing this, which I wrote in my  earlier post .  Aggregate demand was very slack when FDR took office.  FDR showed up in Washington with a plan to start spending a lot of money and thus boost aggregate demand.  The immediate effect was to convince factories they\'d be running down their inventories. That boosted producer prices. It had a much smaller effect on consumer prices because everyone knew the gubmint was going to buy a heck of a lot more producer goods than consumer goods. (The government did buy some consumer goods for the various programs, plus there was a spillover effect, but as the graph clearly shows, the action was on the producer side.)   After a bit of time, the public realized FDR wasn\'t planning just a one-off, but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items. That led them to start using some of their idle capacity, which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory. The rate of price increases thus dropped.   GDP increased the fastest rate in the United States peacetime history since data has been kept. There was a big hiccup, of course, in 1937 when the government cut back on spending for a while.    Sumner\'s most important point:     Prices didn\xe2\x80\x99t start rising when FDR came to Washington with spending plans; they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar.  Furthermore, the weekly rise in the WPI index was highly correlated with weekly increases in the dollar price of gold (i.e. currency depreciation.)  And those changes (in gold prices) were caused by explicit statements and actions by FDR.  Not by fiscal stimulus, which would be expected to appreciate the dollar.   OK.  Using the cool graphical tool from FRED, the Federal Reserve Economic Database, I generated this graph of the series that from what I can tell seems to be Sumner\'s favorite price index when discussing the period:     Figure 1.    Now, take a gander at the graph.  And bear in mind, FDR was inaugurated in March 1933.  But everyone knew what he was going to do, spending-wise, once he showed up.  You can see the decline in prices halt and start reversing even before he took office.  Additionally, I\'m not sure what Sumner means when he refers to the period when he says FDR "began depreciating the dollar."  There was a gold standard in place going back a long time.  That means the value of the dollar was its price in gold.  The price of gold was $20.67 an ounce for decades before FDR took office.  It was $20.67 an ounce until the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934, when the price of gold was changed to $35 an ounce.  (To be precise, the government devalued the dollar on January 31, the day after the Act passed.)    The peak in the curve came in February 1934, days or at most weeks (the index isn\'t that precise) after the Gold Reserve Act.  Put another way...  price inflation using Sumner\'s measure peaked when the currency was devalued.  That is precisely 100% the opposite of what Sumner wrote.    But there are some extenuating circumstances for Sumner.     (The next paragraph summarizes  this story , from the memoirs of Jesse Jones.)    It seems that on October 22, 1933, Jones, the head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Henry Morgenthau, then Farm Credit Administrator but soon to be Treasury Secretary, were told by FDR to come by on October 23 to devaluing the dollar by changing its relationship with gold.  The three men - FDR, Morgenthau, and Jones, then went about raising the price of gold by fiat between then and January 31, 1934, when prices came to rest at $35 an ounce, a price where they stayed through 1971.  I assume that\'s what Sumner is talking about.  So let me modify Figure 1 to only show the period from January to October 1933.     Figure 2.  Now, recall, Sumner\'s evidence that the Keynesian view is wrong and the monetary view is right is:  "Prices didn\xe2\x80\x99t start rising when FDR came to Washington with spending plans; they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar."  And yet...  the graph shows very clearly that prices started to rise when FDR came to Washington with spending plans, not at the end of October when he began depreciating the dollar.  As is very evident from the graph, by that time prices had already been increasing for quite a while.  Wholesale prices, by October 1, were up 17% from the beginning of the year.  If you started in October of 1933, it wasn\'t until December of 1936 before prices increased another 17%.    The point is, Sumner is wrong.  He is very wrong about when prices started to rise.  He is also very wrong about why prices started to rise.  And since "when" and "why" are assumptions in his model, his model is very wrong.    Now, for completeness I\'m going to tackle the other thing Sumner mentioned in his post.  Sumner\'s critique of me includes this:   There are all sorts of the problems with the argument that the inflation of 1933-34 was caused by expectations of fiscal stimulus.  First of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely at variance with Keynesian theory, which Kimel seems to be trying to defend.  Keynesian theory says demand stimulus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise prices when there is \xe2\x80\x9cslack,\xe2\x80\x9d and there has never been more slack in all of American history than in 1933.   The problem for Sumner is that Keynesian theory is merely an extension of good old fashioned Adam Smith.  Prices depend on supply and demand.  You can have a good or service go up in price locally even as it goes down everywhere else.    As I noted in my earlier post, and he quoted:     The immediate effect was to convince factories they\'d be running down their inventories... After a bit of time, the public realized FDR wasn\'t planning just a one-off, but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items. That led them to start using some of their idle capacity, which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory. The rate of price increases thus dropped.   Which of course, is very consistent with the timing of events.    None of this is to pick on Sumner.  There\'s a whole cottage industry dedicated to advancing a story that government spending cannot have a positive effect on the economy during recessions or depressions.  The problem for those trying to advance that story is that government spending does seem to correlate with positive effects during those periods.  So alternate theories are proposed, and have been proposed for decades.  And those theories often make a lot of sense... until you take a close look at the data.      \r\n')

DOT rules require all price advertisements for air travel to list the full price to be paid by the consumer, including all carrier-imposed surcharges.      Starting in June 2011, Spirit used billboards and hand-held posters to advertise new service from Los Angeles, that contained an asterisk next to the advertised fare. On the billboards, the asterisk led to small print that stated additional taxes, fees and conditions would apply, but did not disclose the amount. The posters did not include any information about the taxes and fees. In addition, Spirit sent Twitter feeds announcing one-way fares for $9.  A consumer who clicked on the link was taken to a second Webpage where the carrier disclosed for the first time that the fare did not include all taxes and fees, and that to qualify, a roundtrip ticket had to be purchased. Only after clicking on another link was the amount of additional taxes and fees disclosed.        &#8220;Consumers have a right to know the full price they will be paying when they buy an airline ticket,&#8221; U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a press statement.  &#8220;We expect airlines to treat their passengers fairly, and we will take enforcement action when they violate our price advertising rules.&#8221;      As we've reported in  Best & Worst Airlines , the  proliferation of fees has been a major source of aggravation to airline passengers .

Do right by your neighbors and don't turn a nearby trashcan into a stinkbomb for the remainder of the day.       * See that headphone jack in your computer? Use it.

Some fundamental funds have outdone the S&P 500 and other traditional benchmarks.     \t  In many cases the margins of victory have been small.

Today, "disaster plans" are being made by numerous banks to allow for just that event.      The Wall Street Journal reports  Banks Ponder Euro-Zone Split     A key part of the world\'s foreign-exchange trading infrastructure is bracing itself for the possibility of a breakup of the euro zone, the latest sign investor concerns about the Continent\'s debt crisis are on the rise.      CLS Bank International, which operates a platform in which banks settle most of their currency trades, is running "stress tests" to prepare for the possible dissolution of the euro, according to people familiar with the situation.      Some of the 63 banks that co-own CLS are making similar plans. "We always plan for contingencies," said a senior executive at one of the largest currency-dealing banks.      New York-based CLS is by far the biggest name in the currency market known to be making preparations for such a scenario. Analysts with Japanese bank Nomura Holdings said Friday that a euro breakup is a "very real risk," while HSBC Holdings analysts told clients on Tuesday that it\'s "not unimaginable" for countries to leave the euro zone.   This is the kind of discussion and action that is needed because a breakup appears inevitable.

For many years energy efficiency was the poor relation to cutting-edge clean technology initiatives like wind and solar. But now the more workaday strategies are ...   \r\n')

And according to a new report, passengers on Virgin America should have something to occupy themselves with while waiting on hold, as the average wait time for the carrier is longer than 20 minutes.       In fact, according to the STELLAService study, not only is the 24:19 wait time to speak to a human being by far the longest among the 13 airlines in the survey, it's more than the next four-worst airlines' wait times combined!      And it wasn't just a few ridiculously long waits that threw off the study's numbers for Virgin America -- the survey shows that a whopping 73% of calls placed to the airline required longer than 30 minutes just to speak to a human being.       The airline is currently advising passengers that wait times will likely be longer while it transitions to a new reservation system, but... whoa.      On the opposite end of the spectrum, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines took the top two spots with both carriers only having wait times in the 90 second range. The best of the country's major carriers was American, which clocked in at just over two minutes.       The worst of the majors was United -- more precisely, the Continental call center for United -- with an average wait time of 6:08. If it's any consolation, the United call center wasn't much better (average wait time -- 5:49), so it's not like either airline will definitely drag the other's phone banks into the mire.

Is there any other holiday we celebrate whose sole purpose seems to be eating ourselves into a food coma? For the millions of Americans struggling with diabetes, that can be a very real danger. The traditional Thanksgiving spread, loaded with high fat, high carb, high sugar treats, can be a landmine for a diabetic. Without care, that once a year high-indulgence meal could spell serious hurt if you need to be watching your blood sugar.      Short of sitting in misery watching everyone else eat, or skipping the festivities all together, with a little careful planning you can easily make room at the table for a guest keeping tabs on blood sugar, or seat yourself at someone else\xe2\x80\x99s feast without feeling like you have to pass on everything passed your way.  The  American Diabetes Association offers lots of tips  on how to partake without endangering your health. These include:       --Make choices. Opt for mashed  or  sweet potatoes, stuffing  or  a roll.   --Be vigilant on portion sizes. Want to try everything?  Then keep it to sample size, not super size.   --Compensate for the extra calories by including physical activity in your program. Trade in watching the game on TV for a game of touch football in the yard.      Trying to tailor your treats to better suit the dietary needs of a diabetic guest?  The Mayo Clinic has some  great takes  on traditional Thanksgiving temptations.         And the best recommendation for enjoying your Thanksgiving:  Try more gabbing, less gobbling.  A day spent enjoying the company of family and friends instead of keeping your focus squarely on your plate just might help you safely navigate the holiday foodfest.

Lambasting officials in poor countries for their sticky fingers is usually easier (and less open to legal challenge) than investigating those who suborn them.But on November 2nd Transparency International, a Berlin-based campaigning group, published an updated version of its Bribe Payers Index. Based on questions to 3,000 businessmen, this ranks 28 countries (accounting for 80% of global trade and investment) by the perceived likelihood of their companies paying bribes. Russia and China scored worst by a hefty margin. Dutch and Swiss companies were seen as the cleanest, with Belgium, Germany and Japan close behind. Construction and industries involving government contracts, unsurprisingly, were the dirtiest.Disappointingly, the latest version of the index shows no significant change since the previous edition in 2008. That comes despite some big shifts in national legislation and international anti-bribery activity. Recent prosecutions under America\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act have sent culprits to jail for record terms. The former boss of an America-based telecoms firm, Joel Esquenazi, received a 15-year jail sentence on October 25th for paying nearly $900,000 in bribes to Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s national telephone company.

And the eyebrows are back! I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for two out of those three.    I\xe2\x80\x99m a private guy by nature. Heck, my sense of humor is a textbook case of having developed as a shielding mechanism. But it feels silly now that I ever debated keeping quiet on my health situation.    I was already in the middle of treatment when I wrote that post. I remember hitting publish then flopping over onto the bed for a smooth 10 hour nap. The next time I loaded HIF, the  comment count had skyrocketed  into the hundreds and I was shocked. I actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t read them. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even look at them. I was terrified there\xe2\x80\x99d be a heavy dose of negatvity (I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about anonymous Internet comments here!) and I was already having enough trouble smiling.    The worst period of all occurred a week later when a perfect storm of side effects culminated. For three straight days, my dog and I lied in bed staring at one another, trying to will the other into venturing out to find food. I finally mustered the energy to get out of bed, but the kitchen felt lightyears away, so I sat down in front of my computer and loaded the comments.    You punks had me crying within minutes.    And that was it. That was the lowest I ever got and everything from there was an improvement. It sounds corny, but knowing I had thousands of complete strangers out there rooting for me was encouraging in a way I\xe2\x80\x99d never thought possible.     Suddenly I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fighting this damn thing alone! I knew my family and friends had my back, but I never expected in a million years that people I\xe2\x80\x99d never met would care as well. Every corner of the globe seemed to have a vested interest in vanquishing my tumors. I got emails from Canada, India, Ireland, Australia, Japan, and countless others. HIF doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even post freebies for those countries!    I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to reply to everyone individually, but I read and appreciated each and every comment and email.    And I\xe2\x80\x99m thrilled to say that  I\xe2\x80\x99m now officially in remission .    I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again, but thank you. Y\xe2\x80\x99all were phenomenal to me throughout this and knowing that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t  have  to post freebies every day was a giant load off my back for a few months.  So, again, thank you for the kind words and thoughts and prayers and love and every ounce of goodwill channeled in my direction! It made a huge difference and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget it.     Now go find some turkey, enjoy the day with family and friends, and have a Happy Thanksgiving!     \xc2\xa9 Hey, It's Free!\xe2\x84\xa2 LLC. All rights reserved.

Waving placards and appetising images of aubergines, known in India as brinjal, they shouted themselves hoarse praising the transgenic vegetable.  But most of these men, registered at the consultation as farmers, were in fact landless labourers with no aubergine experience. Mr Ramesh was the first to call their bluff.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve observed before that the lawyers drafting Securities and Exchange Commission filings can be a little slow to adopt the latest trends, or adapt to the latest cultural developments \xe2\x80\x94 see our January  post  on Wikileaks in the filings, for example, or Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s look at\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-dip\xe2\x80\x9d fears  in September last year. So when something starts cropping up in the filings, you know it has truly arrived, at least on some level.    And so it is with  Occupy Wall Street , the quirky demonstration against corporate misdeeds, greed and inequality that has spawned\xc2\xa0 parallel protests \xc2\xa0and spoofs across the country, as well as a bunch of smart, and not-so-smart, signs. (The funniest moment so far, as brought to us by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: Occupy Whitehorse has become a \xe2\x80\x9c virtual occupation \xe2\x80\x9d with the onset of winter \xe2\x80\x94 propane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap, after all.)    As far as we can tell, Occupy Wall Street made its SEC-filing debut yesterday, at least by name, in two separate filings. The first, in an  8-K  from Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts (BEE) \xe2\x80\x94 a $943-million market-cap real-estate investment trust that concentrates on luxury hotels \xe2\x80\x94 landed on the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s virtual desk a few minutes before noon. More on them in a moment.    The second instance came not two hours later, when CME Group (CME) filed its\xc2\xa0 10-Q . CME Group, of course, runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that it would take a dim view of the protests in New York\xe2\x80\x99s financial district and see itself as a potential target of any nefarious foes of the financial system.    In disclosing a new risk factor for investors to consider, the company warns that \xe2\x80\x9cOur role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks.\xe2\x80\x9d It continues:     \xe2\x80\x9cIn connection with the continued economic uncertainty, groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Anonymous, have targeted the financial services industry as part of their protest against the perceived lax regulation of the financial sector and economic inequality.\xe2\x80\x9d     The filing then goes on to explain how\xc2\xa0 Anonymous \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 the online organization perhaps best known for retaliating against businesses that cut off financial and other support for\xc2\xa0 Wikileaks \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ccalled on its supporters to launch a \xe2\x80\x98distributed denial of service\xe2\x80\x99 attack to overwhelm website traffic on NYSE Euronext\xe2\x80\x99s external Web site,\xe2\x80\x9d succeeding in causing a \xe2\x80\x9cbrief outage.\xe2\x80\x9d The disclosure concludes,     \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we have no evidence at this time that we are a specific target of a cyber attack, our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk.\xe2\x80\x9d     We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure if CME really means to lump Occupy Wall Street together with Anonymous so indiscriminately, or if it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of rhetorical sleight of hand. For our part, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of any Occupy Wall Street-linked cyber-attacks \xe2\x80\x94 beyond suggestions that Anonymous members supporting the movement might try to hack the New York Stock Exchange \xe2\x80\x94 and to our eye the two groups seem pretty different, except perhaps for a penchant for pseudo-revolutionary sloganeering and a generally anti-corporatist attitude.    Strategic Hotels seems to have had a more practical and indirect reason for addressing Occupy Wall Street, and did so in response to an analyst\xe2\x80\x99s question. In an accompanying  transcript   of the company\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly results, Enrique Torres, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, asks:        \xe2\x80\x9cLaurence, if I look at the headlines, I see a lot of corporations having now to balance between some job cuts and then their budgets for rewards spending. In addition, you also see the Occupy Wall Street headlines. Combining these two elements, what do you think the perceived risk is of a revisit or return of the AIG effect on corporate luxury spending?\xe2\x80\x9d       You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that American International Group \xc2\xa0(AIG) drew buckets of scorn from lawmakers after feting a hundred advisers at a luxury resort in California not long after securing a federal bailout. The backlash led other companies to  rein in  their own travel and entertainment efforts \xe2\x80\x94 at least for a little while; it looks like even  AIG is back at it , according to Bloomberg News. \xc2\xa0Strategic Hotels\xe2\x80\x99 chief executive,\xc2\xa0Laurence Geller, says he\xe2\x80\x99s heard \xe2\x80\x9cno noise about it, no rumblings\xe2\x80\x9d either \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cat the corporate level.\xe2\x80\x9d Companies are being a little more careful about appearances, but Geller suggests it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem:       \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got to do with prudence, given the headlines. So instead of a divisional president making his decision, it may need a signature from a group CFO or group COO, for example, but that has had no negative impact on it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d       In any case, the two filings mark a milestone of sorts, both for Occupy Wall Street and for the SEC.

"The increase in primary projects offered to the market in November suggests that developers are increasingly becoming aware of the rising cost of credit and [are] looking to increase their property sales to bring in cash," said Barclays analysts in a note released Wednesday in Hong Kong. Barclays said there was a "significant contraction in availability and re-pricing of corporate credit" as European banks withdraw from the Hong Kong loan market, stepping down their presence in the region.

On the basis of two well points in the area, it predicted that there were nearly 40 times the previous projections of all of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s shale resources. It is likely that, even if accurate, only a small proportion of such reserves might actually be recoverable. So far, so good. But there was a problem. In May, the company had to stop drilling because two tiny tremors were recorded in the region. These were so small\xe2\x80\x942.3 and 1.5 magnitude\xe2\x80\x94that they would barely have been felt. Nonetheless, exploration was halted over concerns that the seismic activity had been caused by deep drilling and hydraulic fracturing or \xe2\x80\x9cfracking\xe2\x80\x9d, the process by which huge volumes of water are blasted through rock at high pressure in order to extract the gas.

Among them, Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, insisted on October 13th that recapitalising the banks would not address the real issue, which is the fact that government bonds have lost their status as risk-free assets.Mr Ackermann has a point. Where else can banks keep their spare liquidity when not in government bonds, which used to be regarded by regulators and bank risk managers alike as risk-free assets? That meant that a large chunk of assets on bank balance sheets were counted against capital as zero risk. Not any more.Simply talking about recapitalisation is counter-productive, Mr Ackermann told a gathering in Berlin, because it sends signals that a haircut on sovereign debt (which will further add to the risk burden on bank capital) is ever more likely.These fine arguments did not do his bank much good. Within hours Fitch, a rating agency, had put Deutsche Bank on rating watch negative. Part of Fitch\xe2\x80\x99s argument was that Deutsche might have difficulty reaching its target capitalisation under regulations known as Basel 3. That suggests it would have even more difficulty meeting targets sooner if the European Banking Authority suddenly recommends, as is being considered, an across-the-board core tier 1 capital target of between 7% ...   \r\n')

Since then there has been a horrible predictability about the country\xe2\x80\x99s drug war: each year the number of deaths has risen, most of them concentrated in a handful of cities. But this year both those tendencies look as if they have started to change. The annual death toll seems to have plateaued at around 12,000. Hotspots have cooled, only for violence to invade places previously considered safe.Ciudad Ju\xc3\xa1rez, in Chihuahua state and on the border with Texas, is the most striking example of this. For several years it has been the most dangerous place in Mexico and, by most counts, the world. A city of 1.3m, it saw more than 3,000 murders last year. Yet this year the number of mafia-related killings in Chihuahua has fallen by about a third, according to a tally by  Reforma , a newspaper, as have kidnappings and car thefts. (The government has not released murder statistics in almost a year.) So far this year, Chihuahua state accounts for only around 15% of such murders in Mexico, down from a peak of 32%.The turnaround is the fruit of better co-operation between the municipal, state and federal branches of government, according to H\xc3\xa9ctor Murgu\xc3\xada, Ju\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s mayor.

CFO Magazine (a sister publication of The Economist) found in 2005 that one-fifth of chief executives in America were former chief financial officers, almost double the share of a decade earlier. The importance of quarterly financial reporting, and closer scrutiny since the imposition of the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance act, have put CFOs in the limelight\xe2\x80\x94and given them the chance to shine.  Another factor in reaching the top is whether you stay with the company you joined as a youngster.

By Maria Ant\xc3\xb3nia Pinto de Matos.  Jorge Welsh Books; 1,204 pages; \xc2\xa3900 WHEN the Portuguese began trading with China in the early 1500s, porcelain was one of the luxury goods they carried home in their ships. Only the Chinese knew how to make this delicate, often translucent, material that rings when you tap it. Demand for porcelain made expressly for foreigners spread as far afield as the Netherlands, Germany, Persia, the Ottoman empire, Japan and the young United States.The Chinese manufacturers drew on traditional shapes, but quickly began to branch out, making Western tureens in the form of pigs, cockerels, blue-eyed horned oxheads and bug-eyed crouching crabs, as well as sauceboats shaped as whole multicoloured fish. It was a world apart from the traditional Chinese blue-and-white. The earliest commissions, often with coats of arms, are called the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst orders\xe2\x80\x9d.For Portuguese speakers these works have long been an evocation of a seafaring heritage in which many take pride. Now Chinese collectors are beginning to acquire them as homage to the sophistication and commercial acumen of their forebears. For the moment, though, the best collection is still in Brazil. It is the focus of a new three-volume study of 600 outstanding pieces. Among the rarities acquired by this...    \r\n')

That is the view of many commentators on the euro zone crisis, who think that only when complete catastrophe seems imminent, will European political leaders take the necessary action. (They don't always agree on what that action might be but it is usually some combination of unlimited bond purchases by the European Central Bank and moves towards fiscal union.)Richard McGuire, the fixed income strategist at Rabobank, is very much in that camp. He argues that most of the daily headlines, such as changes in Greek and Italian governments, don't matter. The fundamental problem is one currency and 17 separate fiscal authorities; until that situation is resolved, there will be no solution. Austerity policies won't work.But Mr McGuire has also figured out what the next stage of the crisis will mean for investors.

We had the opportunity to negotiate a couple of times during these transactions.\xc2\xa0 We got some of what we wanted in both cases.     Negotiation Opportunity #1:\xc2\xa0  We bought our new used car from Carmax.\xc2\xa0 Overall this was a great experience.\xc2\xa0 There was one little hiccup at the end: When we went out to pay off our financing with Carmax (which they allow within three business days without paying a dime in interest) neither one of us caught that I had to sign the cashier\xe2\x80\x99s check.\xc2\xa0 (The big one, with a bunch of zeroes.)\xc2\xa0 We were halfway home when my wife got a call on her cell phone asking us to come back.\xc2\xa0 Going back would set us back an hour in driving time alone.\xc2\xa0 I suppose I should have caught that I needed to endorse the check, but I do this once every few years, and they do it dozens of times every day.    Anyway, I went back to the dealership, and when they brought the check back for me to sign, I asked:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cAny way I can get a voucher for an oil change?\xc2\xa0 This set us back 30 minutes of driving one way.\xe2\x80\x9d    A few minutes later, I walked out with a $25 gift certificate.     Negotiation Opportunity #2: \xc2\xa0 Our long-time mechanic bought our old car after we had it towed to his shop and after he gave the estimates to us to have the transmission fixed.\xc2\xa0 He likes the kind of van we have, except for the transmission.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s fixed up a few of them and uses them as loaners for customers.    He said that it would be well worth it to him to pay $500 for the van.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had \xe2\x80\x9ccash for your junk car\xe2\x80\x9d tow away other vehicles of ours for far less than that, so $500 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad at all for a vehicle that needed about $3,000 worth of parts and labor to be roadworthy again.    My wife was the one who took the title over to him.\xc2\xa0 She asked if the offer could be more if he gave it in store credit.\xc2\xa0 (We have no reason to look elsewhere, as we\xe2\x80\x99re quite happy with his service.)    He bought the van for $750 in store credit \xe2\x80\x94 50% more than he offered in cash.     Store credit is cheap for the store     The connection between these two wins is that we made it clear that store credit was just fine with us.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I would have gotten cash back from Carmax for my trouble had I asked for it, and I know that we would have gotten less for the van in cash.    There are at least three reasons why this make sense:        The money is locked up in the business.\xc2\xa0  The business owner keeps their money for now and pays in future goods and services.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a small risk that the business could go under and the money would go with it.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s a good relationship and both parties will continue to do business together, then great.     Store credit is cheaper for the business than an equivalent amount of cash.\xc2\xa0  It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to cost Carmax $25 to give me $25 worth of service.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to cost our mechanic $750 to give us $750 worth of services.\xc2\xa0 If it does, then they\xe2\x80\x99re working for nothing.\xc2\xa0 This is the same reason why restaurants love giving out soda: \xe2\x80\x9cBuy two hamburgers and get a medium drink for free.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The drink costs them about a nickel, but the value to the customer is $1.19.     You\xe2\x80\x99re on their side with the transaction.\xc2\xa0   Indirectly you\xe2\x80\x99re saying \xe2\x80\x9cI want to continue doing business with you\xe2\x80\x9d when you suggest compensation in store credit.\xc2\xa0 It gives the business that warm, fuzzy feeling.

Has the latest stage of the euro zone debt crisis been part of a cunning plan? Both Greece and Italy are forming technocratic governments and Berlusconi has finally gone. By the end of this week, indeed, the governments of all five countries in the PIIGS grouping (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) will have changed since the start of the crisis if, as expected, the ruling Socialists lose power in Spain. The prospects for economic reform in the peripheral European countries look a lot stronger than before.Who is behind this plan? One could point the finger at Angela Merkel or at the European Central Bank; by not giving the peripheral nations a blank cheque from the German voters, or unlimited money creation, they have forced those nations to make hard choices.If it is a plan, then, to quote Blackadder, it has been "more cunning than a fox who\'s been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University". Until this autumn, the apparent aim of all the EU\'s rescue packages was to stop the crisis spreading to Italy and Spain; it has spread to both. Indeed, the borrowing costs of supposedly core countries like France and the Netherlands have been rising relative to those of Germany.

Can I Retire?  is part of his \xe2\x80\x9c100 Pages or Less\xe2\x80\x9d series, and, well, the main text of the book ends squarely on page 99, so it\xe2\x80\x99s truth in advertising.\xc2\xa0 His motivation in putting this series together was to give essential information on a particular topic in a size that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so daunting to read.\xc2\xa0 He fully admits that his book is just the beginning of answering the question in the title, so with that in mind, I read the book.    I enjoyed it.\xc2\xa0 The book was well written and free of financial jargon, but at the same time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I was in third grade while reading it.\xc2\xa0 It was a quick read; I got through it in maybe 1 1/2 hours, and part of the time I was riding up to a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xc2\xa0 Which, again, is the point of the book:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an approachable and doable introduction to the topic.     Standard topics with some essential details     The topics are nothing terribly mind-blowing:       Calculating how much you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to retire    The 4% withdrawal rate rule    Single-premium immediate annuities    Index funds, exchange-traded funds, bonds    IRAs and IRA accounts    Tax consequences of conversions, rollovers, and the like    Social Security       I picked up a number of things along the way.\xc2\xa0 Here are a couple of them:        Dollar-cost averaging is a two-edged sword.\xc2\xa0  In a rising market, dollar cost averaging helps to automate the process of buying low (to sell high later).\xc2\xa0 But in a falling (or fallen) market, withdrawing a fixed amount has the opposite effect: selling low.     The overview of annuities is very good.\xc2\xa0  I knew vaguely what annuities were but Chapter 4 laid the basics out very well, especially the pros and cons of annuities, fixed return vs. variable return annuities, and diversifying annuities.     Having a tiered risk/reward investment structure in retirement is a good idea.\xc2\xa0  The idea and explanation of having short-, mid-, and long-term investments in retirement was clearly presented.\xc2\xa0 (Long-term in retirement is more than five years out.)       All in all, this was a well-organized introduction to answering the question of   Can I Retire?   and I recommend it.\xc2\xa0 The Kindle edition is certainly worth $5 if you\xe2\x80\x99re new to retirement planning.

'   by   Mike Kimel    In this post, I will show that during the New Deal era, changes in the real economic growth rate can be explained almost entirely by the earlier changes in federal government\'s non-defense spending. There are going to be a lot of words at first - but if you\'re the impatient type, feel free to jump ahead to the graphs. There are three of them.  The story I\'m going to tell is a very Keynesian story. In broad strokes, when the Great Depression began in 1929, aggregate demand dropped a lot. People stopped buying things leading companies to reduce production and stop hiring, which in turn reduced how much people could buy and so on and so forth in a vicious cycle. Keynes\' approach, and one that FDR bought into, was that somebody had to step in and start buying stuff, and if nobody else would do it, the government would.     So an increase in this federal government spending would lead to an increase in economic growth. Even a relatively small boost in government spending, in theory, could have a big consequences through the multiplier effect - the government hires some construction companies to build a road, those companies in turn purchase material from third parties and hire people, and in the end, if the government spent X, that could lead to an effect on the economy exceeding X.   This increased spending by the Federal government typically came in the form of roads and dams, the CCC and the WPA and the Tennessee Valley Authority, in the Bureau of Economic Analysis\' National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables it falls under the category of nondefense federal spending.  Now, in a time and place like the US in the early 1930s, it could take a while for such nondefense spending by the federal government to work its way through the economy. Commerce moved more slowly back in the day. It was more difficult to spend money at the time than it is now, particularly if you were employed on building a road or a dam out in the boondocks. You might be able to spend some of your earnings at a company store, but presumably the bulk of what you made wouldn\'t get spent until you get somewhere close to civilization again.   So let\'s make a simple assumption - let\'s say that according to this Keynesian theory we\'re looking at, growth in any given year a function of nondefense spending in that year and the year before. Let\'s keep it very simple and say the effect of nondefense spending in the current year is exactly twice the effect of nondefense spending in the previous year. Thus, restated,   (1) change in economic growth, t =  f[(2/3)*change in nondefense spending t,  (1/3)*change in nondefense spending t-1]  For the change in economic growth, we can simply use Growth Rate of Real GDP at time t less Growth Rate of Real GDP at time t-1. The growth rate of real GDP is provided by the BEA in an easy to use spreadsheet  here .  Now, it would seem to make sense that nondefense spending could simply be adjusted for inflation as well. But it isn\'t that simple. Our little Keynesian story assumes a multiplier, but we\'re not going to estimate that multiplier or this is going to get too complicated very quickly, particularly given the large swing from deflation to inflation that occurred in the period. What we can say is that from the point of view of companies that have gotten a federal contract, or the point of view of people hired to work on that contract who saved what they didn\'t spend in their workboots, or storekeepers serving those people, they would have spent more of their discretionary income if they felt richer and would have spent less if they felt poorer.   And an extra 100 million in nondefense spending (i.e., contracts coming down the pike) will seem like more money if its a larger percentage of the most recently observed GDP than if its a smaller percentage of the most recently observed GDP. Put another way, context for nondefense spending in a period of rapid swings in deflation and inflation can be provided by comparing it to last year\'s GDP.   So let\'s rewrite equation (1) as follows:  (2) Growth in Real GDP t - Growth in Real GDP t-1 f[(2/3)*change in {nondefense spending t / GDP t-1},  (1/3)*change in {nondefense spending t-1 / GDP t-2}]  Put another way... this simple story assumes that changes in the Growth Rate in Real GDP (i.e., the degree to which the growth rate accelerated or decelerated) can be explained by the rate at which nondefense spending as a perceived share of the economy accelerated or decelerated. Thus, when the government increased nondefense spending (as a percent of how big the people viewed the economy) quickly, that translated a rapid increase in real GDP growth rates. Conversely, when the government slowed down or shrunk nondefense spending, real GDP growth rates slowed down or even went negative.   Note that GDP and nondefense spending figures are "midyear" figures. Note also that at the time, the fiscal year ran from July to June... so the amount of nondefense spending that showed up in any given calendar year would have been almost completely determined through the budget process a year earlier.   As an example... nondefense spending figures for 1935 were made up of nondefense spending through the first half of the year, which in turn were determined by the budget which had been drawn up in the first half of 1934. In other words, equation (2) explains changes in real GDP growth rates based on spending determined one and two years earlier. If there is any causality, it isn\'t that growth rates in real GDP are moving the budget.  Since there stories are cheap, the question of relevance is this: how well does equation (2) fit the data? Well, I\'ll start with a couple graphs. And then I\'ll ramp things up a notch (below the fold).   Figure 1 below shows the right hand side of equation (2) on the left axis, and the left hand side of equation (2) on the right axis. (Sorry for reversing axes, but since the right hand side of the equation (2) leads it made sense to put it on the primary axis.)          Notice that the changes in nondefense spending growth and the changes in the rate of real GDP growth correlate very strongly, despite the fact that the former is essentially determined a year and two years in advance of the latter.   Here\'s the same information with a scatterplot:         So far, it would seem that either the government\'s changes to nondefense spending growth were a big determinant of real economic growth, or there\'s one heck of a coincidence, particularly since I didn\'t exactly "fit" the nondefense function.  But as I noted earlier in this post, after the first two graphs, I would step things up a notch. That means I\'m going to show that the fit is even tighter than it looks based on the two graphs above. And I\'m going to do so with a comment and a third graph.   Here\'s the comment: 1933 figures do not provide information about how the New Deal programs worked. After all, the figures are midyear - so the real GDP growth would be growth from midyear 1932 to midyear 1933. But FDR didn\'t become President until March of 1933.   So... here\'s Figure 2 redrawn, to include only data from 1934 to 1938.         While I\'m a firm believer in the importance of monetary policy, for a number of reasons I don\'t believe it made much of a difference in the New Deal era. As Figure 3 shows, changes in nondefense spending - hiring people to build roads, dams, and the like, explain subsequent changes in real GDP growth rates exceptionally well from 1934 to 1938. This simple model explains more than 90% of the change in real GDP growth rates over that period.   Of course, after 1938, the relationship breaks down... but by then the economy was on the mend (despite the big downturn in 1938). More importantly (I believe - haven\'t checked this yet!), defense spending began to become increasingly important. People who might have been employed building roads in 1935 might have found employment refurbishing ships going to the Great Britain in 1939.   ---  As always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.

At ten she was gliding round to the waltz and the foxtrot at social-dancing classes in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As a young woman, she was taught by Martha Graham and danced in her troupe at Carnegie Hall. (Later she persuaded her husband, Gerald R., to give Martha a medal; if you kept on at a man long enough, he would agree to anything.) In the White House she tried out disco steps, and shimmied to the Bump at dinner-dances. But if you tried to teach her an arabesque or a  jet\xc3\xa9e , she turned into the worst ballet dancer who ever came down the road. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to be constrained like that. She was, as she put it once, a booby who only wanted to soar.      Of course, she could be proper too. In her brief stint as First Lady, from August 1974 to January 1977, she was always immaculately turned out. She wore white gloves (\xe2\x80\x9cthese mitts\xe2\x80\x9d) whenever she had to do so. But, much as she adored clothes\xe2\x80\x94the room-long rack at her house in Virginia had fallen off the wall, she had so many\xe2\x80\x94all the ladylike public behaviour could be a bit of a strain. So too could the split-second scheduling, when she liked to linger in bed in the mornings till 9.30 or so, putting on her makeup in her own good time. It sometimes happened that she had to greet the public from the balcony with her nightgown tucked up under her coat. \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Betty!\xe2\x80\x9d they...    \r\n')

That's down a touch from the 9.5% rate notched in the second quarter, and it's a bit below expectations for 9.3% growth. Markets didn't much care for the news, but 9.1% is a pretty healthy clip given the weakness spreading across most of the world economy. Industrial production grew somewhat faster than expected, a nice surprise given PMI numbers that have shown China's manufacturing sector contracting slightly for much of the quarter. Generally, speaking, the hoped-for soft landing seems to be on track.At FT Alphaville, however, Kate Mackenzie collects comments on the report that provide reason for pessimism. In particular, China's exports have been falling rapidly in recent months, and especially sales to Europe. That may throw a wrench in China's plans to rebalance its economy. Amid strong export demand, it would be easier for China to relax the rules that artificially constrain consumption. Given a broad slowdown in key export markets, however, China may be reluctant to give up any of the edges that its manufacturers enjoy.Michael Pettis has written that Japan's growth slowdown didn't generate the public outcry one might have expected because beneath the headline figures the Japanese economy was rebalancing itself toward greater reliance on consumption.

First introduced in 2010 as part of a public-education campaign, the Naughty & Nice Holiday List looks at the good and not-so-good shopping policies and the companies behind them.  This year&#8217;s List includes high profile companies from a variety of fields including: air travel, electronics, apparel retailing, credit-card lending and concert ticketing.      The Naughty & Nice Holiday List is based on input from Consumer Reports reporters and editors who cover shopping, travel, hospitality and telecommunications. Consumer Reports notes that the Naughty & Nice Holiday List is based on specific policies and is not reflective of a company as a whole.      The success of our roundup--timed to coincide with the holiday season, when travel and shopping are at a peak and shoppers at their most vulnerable--has prompted Consumer Reports to make the campaign an annual event. Our 2011 list once again puts some very visible companies in the hot seat for fine print, befuddling fees, and the like. It gives other companies points for good behavior.      We&#8217;ve checked each policy either by direct contact or reading through the details on the company&#8217;s website. Although we cite companies by name, other players may engage in similar business practices&#8212;for better or worse. And praise or blame for a specific policy doesn&#8217;t mean we give a thumbs up or down for everything else that company does or the way it treats customers.        Nice:        \xe2\x80\xa2 Bi-Lo supermarkets.  Most supermarkets will refund the purchase price of a product that doesn&#8217;t meet expectations, but this Southern chain offers a double-money-back guarantee on every item it sells whatever the reason for the return.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Cablevision.  Telecom companies are a frequent target of consumer displeasure, but this industry giant offers more to subscribers who sign up for its Optimum Triple Play - Internet, phone, and TV service - free movie tickets on Tuesdays and deeply discounted tickets on other days. Customers who sign up for Cablevision&#8217;s Optimum Rewards program (it&#8217;s free) also get perks like discounted popcorn and soda at participating theaters.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Live Nation.  The world&#8217;s largest live-entertainment promoter, ticket distributor, and artist-management firm gives fans three days to cancel their ticket order and get a refund at participating venues (typically until one week before the event). Live Nation also lets customers exchange seats for better ones that become available after a purchase.         \xe2\x80\xa2 American Express.  The company offers peace of mind at no extra cost. If a cardholder buys a covered item with his or her Amex card and unsuccessfully tries to return it to the merchant within 90 days, American Express can refund the full purchase price, up to $300 ($1,000 per account per year).       \xe2\x80\xa2 Orvis.  Many e-commerce companies encourage questions by phone or e-mail. But this seller of fishing gear and outdoorsy clothes offers help if a customer lingers on a product long enough, initiating dialog via live chat.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Crutchfield.  The electronics merchant offers help with installation, setup, troubleshooting 24/7, and tech support at no extra charge for the life of the gear purchased.        \xe2\x80\xa2 Costco.  The chain has a generous return policy and provides free tech support for many electronics products. Less known is that it automatically extends the manufacturer&#8217;s original warranty on TVs and computers to two years from the date of purchase.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Amazon.com.  The e-tailing giant has taken a stand against wastefuland hard-to-open product packaging. It encourages customers to share photographs and feedback with manufacturers, who can then modify their package designs and submit them to Amazon&#8217;s engineers to see if they qualify as frustration-free. If so, the companies can use the &#8220;Certified Frustration-Free&#8221; logo as a marketing tool. To date, hundreds of products from companies including Philips, Garmin, and Logitech have met the criteria.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Microsoft.  If someone buys and installs software on his or her computer, most retailers won&#8217;t give out a refund, no matter how much the customer hates it. Not so with Microsoft. Consumers dissatisfied with a Microsoft software or hardware purchase from any retailer can send it back to the company within 45 days for a refund and reimbursement of shipping costs up to $7.       \xe2\x80\xa2 REI.  The outdoor/adventure outfitter has one of the most liberal return policies around. It accepts returns or exchanges at any time for any reason, and makes the process simple. Customers can return any item by mail or to any REI store regardless of location, whether they bought online, by mail, or in an REI store. The policy even applies to goods bought from REI&#8217;s online outlet.          Naughty:        \xe2\x80\xa2 AirTran.  Imagine that you bought a shirt and were charged extra for the buttons. Ridiculous, right? But this Orlando-based airline&#8217;s discounted coach and sale-fare flights don&#8217;t include the price of the seat. If you - like most people -- want to select your seat when you book online, AirTran will charge $6 to $20 each way. Otherwise, you can show up at the gate and take your chances that you don&#8217;t get stuck with a noisy back-row seat near the lavatory.       \xe2\x80\xa2 RadioShack.  The company acknowledges that it sometimes charges different prices for the same item. When a reader shopped for an HDMI audio-video cable, the store price was nearly twice the online price. Asked why, a customer-service supervisor said he couldn&#8217;t do anything about the discrepancy, and directed the reader to the fine print on RadioShack&#8217;s website.       \xe2\x80\xa2 American Apparel.  On the plus side, the Los Angeles-based company still makes clothes in the United States. However, it has two different return policies. Online customers have 45 days to return an item for a full refund or credit; store customers have 30 days and receive a merchandise credit.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Verizon Wireless.  The company tells the Federal Communications Commission that it voluntarily provides ample warning to customers who seem about to exceed their monthly allotment of minutes, messages, or data, so a mandatory rule that would make it issue such alerts isn't necessary. But we caught Verizon doing -- and admitting to  -- something else. Two staffers who are Verizon customers recently were notified only after they went over their allotment, at which time the company tried to upsell them to a pricier plan. When contacted by our reporter, a company spokesman acknowledged that its voluntary alert system isn't always reliable. But it now looks like better protection from &#8220;bill shock&#8221; is on its way. Under a mid-October deal with the FCC, members of CTIA - The Wireless Association, a trade group representing 97 percent of wireless carriers, agreed to begin issuing alerts of impending overages. Full implementation of the alert system could take until April 2013.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Liberty Travel.  Tour operators often advertise very low prices to suck in customers. But the quotes sometimes exclude high taxes and fees. Take Liberty Travel (billed as &#8220;America&#8217;s vacation experts&#8221;). It offers an eye-popping deal such as a three-night Disney vacation package, including airfare, theme park ticket, and some food, starting at $559 per person. But hold on. The 283 words of tiny type at the bottom of the ad say that the price excludes taxes and fees of up to $250, baggage fees, or other fees charged by the airline. And if someone needs to switch a flight? It&#8217;ll cost as much as $200 extra.       \xe2\x80\xa2 The Swiss Colony.  Like many businesses, the 85-year-old Wisconsin-based mail-order food firm ties its delivery fees to the dollar amount of an order rather than the size and weight of the package - a practice we&#8217;ve criticized before. Thus, if an order totals $25, shipping and processing is $5.95, but if it costs a penny more, the freight jumps to $7.95 Beyond that, The Swiss Colony asks customers to fork over another $2.99 per shipping address for unspecified reasons. So we called the company for an explanation. The customer service rep told us the surcharge reflects the cost of a mailing label.       \xe2\x80\xa2 Southwest Airlines.  For an extra $10 per flight, travelers can complete online check-in earlier than the usual 24 hours before takeoff, improve their boarding group position, snag a better seat (Southwest doesn&#8217;t assign seats; it&#8217;s first-come, first-served), and thus get their pick of available overhead bin space. It sounds benign enough. Yet, it&#8217;s another reminder that a basic ticket doesn&#8217;t buy much these days, and how price-conscious customers can get penalized if they don&#8217;t go for the upgrade.       \xe2\x80\xa2 SiriusXM satellite radio.  If a subscriber wants to receive a bill in the mail and pay by check (the old-fashioned way), he or she will get socked with a $2 surcharge every month. The penalty can be avoided if the customer gives Sirius credit-card information and elects to be billed electronically on a recurring basis.       \xe2\x80\xa2 GameStop.  A Fortune 500 company with more than 6,500 stores worldwide, this video game software and hardware merchant has a laundry list of conditions governing returns and exchanges. And in the end, GameStop proclaims, &#8220;We reserve the right to refuse any return.&#8221;       \r\n")

The company\xe2\x80\x99s founder and chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, confessed to a $1.47 billion fraud on its balance sheet, which he and his brother, Satyam\xe2\x80\x99s managing director, had disguised from the company\xe2\x80\x99s board, senior managers and auditors for several years. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Raju wrote.

That was a blow in the fight against climate change: if carbon dioxide can be stripped out of power plant emissions and other factories and stored safely underground, fossil fuels could be used without such damage to the planet. The government has promised to pay \xc2\xa31 billion for a pilot project. Since the Longannet work was going to cost more to build than that, it was abandoned.Even as that project was being ditched, government officials were quietly murmuring about a proposal for CCS at a gas-fired power station at Petershead, Aberdeenshire. Sure enough, a few weeks on another piece of good news has dribbled out: SSE, which runs the Petershead plant, has teamed up with Shell on the project it is proposing. SSE had already applied for European funding for CCS at Petershead. But the tie-up with the oil and gas major is new.  It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a good idea. This should give SSE extra cash to help fund a detailed engineering design. As importantly, it means that, if the project goes ahead, the gas will be transported to the Shell-operated Goldeneye gas field in the North Sea. The idea is to use existing infrastructure as far as possible. Shell is clearly keen to get involved in CCS \xe2\x80\x94 it was also a partner of ...   \r\n')

A credit rating is an opinion about the likelihood that a borrower will repay its debts. The issuers of these opinions are largely based in America, a land where free speech is constitutionally guaranteed.

During bull markets, the growth funds soared as investors bid up prices of fast-moving technology and consumer stocks. Then the rally ended and growth stocks crashed hard as overvalued shares sank.      Because of the regular collapses, the large growth category has often trailed large value. From 1928 through 2010, large growth stocks returned 8.8% annually, compared to a figure of 11.1% for large value, according to Ibbotson Associates. In recent years, growth stocks have sunk twice -- after the Internet bubble burst in 2000 and when the financial crisis unfolded in 2008. Hurt by the downturns, large growth funds trailed the S&P 500 during the past decade, while large value funds outdid the benchmark.           Should you avoid large growth funds altogether? Probably not. Growth stocks excel sometimes, and they can help to diversify portfolios. But to get steadier results, consider a growth fund that aims to limit losses in downturns. A solid choice is Capital Advisors Growth Fund . The fund often lags in bull markets, but it shines in hard times. In 2008, Capital Advisors outdid 98% of competitors and topped the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points, according to Morningstar. By managing risk, the fund returned 2.8% annually during the past decade, outdoing the S&P 500 and surpassing 66% of competitors.     ...

In recent years, growth stocks have sunk twice -- after the Internet bubble burst in 2000 and when the financial crisis unfolded in 2008. Hurt by the downturns, large growth funds trailed the S&P 500 during the past decade, while large value funds outdid the benchmark.           Should you avoid large growth funds altogether? Probably not. Growth stocks excel sometimes, and they can help to diversify portfolios. But to get steadier results, consider a growth fund that aims to limit losses in downturns. A solid choice is Capital Advisors Growth Fund . The fund often lags in bull markets, but it shines in hard times. In 2008, Capital Advisors outdid 98% of competitors and topped the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points, according to Morningstar. By managing risk, the fund returned 2.8% annually during the past decade, outdoing the S&P 500 and surpassing 66% of competitors.     ...

But the prospect of moving from Atlanta to Ohio was too much for a second top executive at The Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s Co. (WEN), prompting him to resign while leaving with several million dollars.\xc2\xa0(We wrote a\xc2\xa0 post \xc2\xa0last May about Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s first Ohio-related resignation.)    The departure of Roland Smith, the company\xe2\x80\x99s President and CEO, was actually announced in a two-sentence section of an\xc2\xa0 8-K  filed September 2.\xc2\xa0The rest of the filing introduced Smith\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Emil Brolick, and disclosed the terms of Brolick\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 employment agreement \xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0 deferred compensation plan \xc2\xa0(the subject of this September\xc2\xa0 post ). What was clearly missing, though, was any explanation for Smith\xe2\x80\x99s exit or a disclosure of what the company might pay him on his way out the door.    We now have the answers to those questions, thanks to the  10-Q  and attachments that Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s filed with the SEC on November 9. You may recall that \xe2\x80\x93 until recently \xe2\x80\x93 Arby\xe2\x80\x99s (headquartered in Atlanta) used to be part of Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s. But once Arby\xe2\x80\x99s was sold, Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Atlanta base. The company decreed that all of its top executives would be based in Dublin, Ohio.    Smith sent the company a couple of letters, including this September 1 letter attached as an  exhibit  to the 10-Q. After referring to his  December, 2008 employment agreement , Smith then explained that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to move to Ohio, and that the company\xe2\x80\x99s request that he do so breached a promise in his employment agreement (specifically, that the company wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cwithout your consent, [require you to relocate] to a work situs not in the Atlanta, Georgia greater metropolitan area\xe2\x80\x9d). Here\xe2\x80\x99s a snippet from the exhibit:       \xe2\x80\x9cThis letter agreement supplements my earlier letter agreement with the Company dated July 20, 2011 regarding the relocation of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters and the occurrence of a \xe2\x80\x9cTriggering Event\xe2\x80\x9d under the terms of the Employment Letter Agreement. This letter agreement is being delivered in connection with the offer of employment made recently by the Company to a candidate to assume the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company, with such employment to commence on or about September 12, 2011.\xe2\x80\x9d       We can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what the July 20 letter says because it was never filed with the SEC. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the company knew that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s resignation was coming, since Brolick\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and the announcement of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s departure occurred simultaneously. And the 10-Q itself has a brief section at the bottom of page 26 which disclosed that:        \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6in accordance with the termination provisions of [Smith's] related employment agreement, the Companies incurred termination costs of  $12,568  \xc2\xa0(principally for required payments of\xc2\xa0  $7,987  \xc2\xa0and vesting of previously issued stock awards of\xc2\xa0  $4,581  )\xc2\xa0   in the third quarter of 2011.\xe2\x80\x9d        Don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled, though: Those figures are \xe2\x80\x9cIn Thousands Except Per Share Amounts,\xe2\x80\x9d so we\xe2\x80\x99re really talking about millions here.    Although Smith officially ceased serving as the CEO and President on September 12, he is still working as a \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Advisor\xe2\x80\x9d and director until December 30, 2011. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s letter confirms his arrangement with Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s: He would \xe2\x80\x9cprovide advice and counsel as requested,\xe2\x80\x9d and the company would continue to pay him \xe2\x80\x9cat the same compensation level (including without limitation salary, bonus and employee benefits)\xe2\x80\x9d. The April, 2011  proxy \xc2\xa0revealed that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s base salary was $1.15 million, on top of which he received a bonus and equity awards that bumped his total compensation up to more than $4.91 million. Thus, he is set to earn quite a bit more before he and Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s part ways at the end of the year.    But don\xe2\x80\x99t despair, Ohioans. Despite the fact that some of Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s executives don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in your state, we know that any place that inspired Leonard Bernstein and company to write \xe2\x80\x9cOhio\xe2\x80\x9d (from the musical \xe2\x80\x9c Wonderful Town\xe2\x80\x9d ) must be a very nice place indeed.

been having a bit of back and forth with Scott Sumner.   Here  is his latest post, helpfully entitled: "A suggestion for Mike Kimel."  His key suggestion:   "Please take a close look at the data from the Great Depression, before doing more posts claiming I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the facts."  He then goes on to point out he\'s been studying the 1933 period for 20 years.   From there he goes on to explain my first mistake:   He insists that FDR\xe2\x80\x99s dollar depreciation program began in October 1933, even though all economic historians agree in began in mid-April 1933, when the exchange rate for the dollar began declining (against gold and against other currencies.)  He insists prices began rising before FDR took office off, which is not true.  He presents a graph that he claims shows prices rising before FDR took office, but his graph shows inflation rates, not the price level.  In fact, the graph actually supports my argument that inflation didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn positive until after FDR took office.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between the rate of inflation and the price level.   OK.  Let\'s redo the graph showing not inflation but rather the price level.  And I\'ll keep it very simple...  I will limit it to two points.  Well, three, though the third is not exactly on the curve so to speak.  As before, I\'m still using PPI because its the publicly available source most closely related to the prices Sumner seems to be discussing, and I\'ll use the graphics tool at the  Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)       Figure 1.    The graph shows the PPI for February and March of 1933.  FDR took office in March 1933.   As I noted in  my previous post ,   You can see the decline in prices halt and start reversing even before he took office.   Now, I don\'t remember arguing that inflation didn\'t turn positive before then.  To me, its a big deal that PPI hit rock bottom and reversed itself.  Getting out of free-fall was in itself a big deal.   Here\'s a graph for 1929 to 1934 to give you an idea:      Figure 2.   Note that February 1933 happened to be the low point for PPI during its entire history, and the PPI had been calculated since 1913.   But there\'s another important point in the quote I provided above, namely this:   He insists that FDR\xe2\x80\x99s dollar depreciation program began in October 1933, even though all economic historians agree in began in mid-April 1933, when the exchange rate for the dollar began declining (against gold and against other currencies.)   This isn\'t quite right.  As I\'ll make clear, I don\'t think the dollar actually depreciated against gold until January 1934.  Sumner was so insistent on this depreciation occurring before then that I spent a bit of time on google and found a story by  Jesse Jones , head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, about how FDR had him and soon to be Treasury Secretary Morgenthau help him (FDR) revalue the price of gold.   Now, I am not an economic historian, and I\'m not sure I know any these days, so for all I know, Sumner is correct about what all economic historians agree happened.  I am, instead a data guy.  I like data.  Scratch that.  I love data.  I go through data in my spare time.   Most of the stuff I do at this blog, for instance, has absolutely nothing to do with my day job.  Nothing.  But its an opportunity to play with data.  My wife usually scratches her head wondering why I do this kind of thing, but everyone needs a hobby and I don\'t watch tv.  One thing I\'ve learned with data is that its generally important to go back as close to the original source of data as possible.  Another is to know something about your sources.  Go through the data.  Read footnotes.   So in that spirit, I decided to try see what I can learn by looking for data from the era or thereabouts, ideally coming directly from the folks who collect it.  I have not succeeded in finding a series that shows what Sumner claims.  In fact, data from around that era, particularly on gold prices, isn\'t easy to come by.  But I have found a few examples.  For instance, Table Number 230 of the  1936 Statistical Abstract of the United States  shows the supply of gold in the United States on June 30 of each year (going back annually to 1887, and with selected years before then).  The data seems to originate with the Treasury and the Fed, though I haven\'t been able to locate the contemporaneous originals.   Footnote 1 reads in part:   By a proclamation of the President dated Jan. 31, 1934 the weight of the gold dollar was reduced from 25.8 to 15 5/21 grains of gold, 0.9 fine. The value of gold is therefore based on $35 per fine ounce beginning June 1934; theretofore it is based on $20.67 per fine ounce.   In other words a couple months after Sumner and other economic historians believe the dollar had started losing value against gold, the Fed and/or the Treasury were reporting to the Census (which publishes the Statistical Abstract) that the price of gold was still exactly the same as it had been.)   Now, its possible the Census or the Fed or the Treasury made a mistake and it went uncorrected by the time of the 1936 Statistical Abstract.   So one source is not enough, especially when Sumner and "all economic historians" agree it is wrong.   Which leads to a Fed document called  Banking and Monetary Statistics 1914 - 1941 .  This is from the section on gold (bottom paragraph, left hand column, page 522)   All figures are in dollars, calculated at the rate of $20.67 per fine ounce of gold through January 1934 and $35 per fine ounce thereafter (except that the figures for the year 1934 in Table 159 are based upon the $35 gold price).  The change in rate results from the fact that on January 31, 1934, the dollar was devalued by 40.94 per cent in terms of gold in accordance with a proclamation issued by the President.   If you\'re curious, $35 - $20.67 = $14.33.  $14.33 happens to be 40.94% of $35.   The document is chock full of tables that show, including other things, the monthly value of US gold holdings.    Where dollar figures are involved, those tables also carry a helpful note indicating the price as $20.67 an ounce through January 1934, and $35 an ounce thereafter.  Note that the Fed valued monthly holdings at $20.67 an ounce in April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December of 1933 when, all along, according to Scott Sumner who spent 20 years studying the era and "all economic historians," insist the price of gold had been rising at the time.  I\'ve stumbled on a few other sources as well but they don\'t look any different.  I\'m just not seeing the series that shows the dollar price of gold rising during the months from April 1933 to January 1934.   So what is going on?  I\'m going to split the baby here and suggest that both Scott Sumner and "all economic historians" are right that there was a devaluation, and the Fed and the Treasury and the Statistical Abstract of the United States were (and are) right that there wasn\'t.  But the way in which they are right is very definitely not a good thing for Scott Sumner and "all economic historians."  See, as I said above, I\'m not an economic historian, but I did spend my formative years in South American in the 1970s and 1980s.  As anyone who spent roughly the same years in the region as I did could tell you, or as any Zimbabwean can do today, during times of turmoil (which can last decades) the official exchange rate can come to bear no relationship with the actual price at which a currency trades against something that is considered more stable and more desirable to hold.  Heck, you don\'t have to track down someone from Arrgentina or Zimbabwe - ask any European who ever visited the Soviet Block and traded in some Western currency at the airport or the border about how unrealistic official exchange rates could be.  In many an economic basket case, the likelihood that a transaction takes place at anything resembling the official exchange rate is similar to the probability that someone walks into a Chevrolet dealership and pays the MSRP, in cash.   And like the MSRP, the official exchange rate has a purpose.  Yes, there\'s always someone clueless or coerced enough to pay that price.  But for the most part, its a fiction that either serves as a baseline for something or papers over something the government wants to really do, usually printing money.  Its a handy excuse to get from point A to point B, and if the excuse doesn\'t fly, another one will do.  My guess, and I\'ll repeat that I\'m not an economic historian, is that when FDR and Jones and Morgenthau were picking prices out of the air, it was in that vein.  The country was in turmoil when FDR took office, and there were fears that if things got worse there would be an armed insurrection.  It wasn\'t a time for half measures.  My guess is the mood in the White House at the time was best summarized by a quote decades later from the immortal John Candy, "There\'s a time to think, and a time to act. And this, gentlemen, is no time to think."    So what did the fiction of changing the price gold accomplish if nobody else believe that the price had actually changed?  I suspect it meant, in practice, that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation could pay more than $20.67 an ounce for gold.  And why would the RFC (which, I note, could borrow outside the budget) want to pay more than $20.67 an ounce for gold if that was the price everyone was accepting?  Think of the RFC the way you think of the Fed trying to bail out banks in recent years - loaning money at below market rates to banks who then used the money to buy Treasuries which paid higher rates.  In effect, paying more than $20.67 an ounce was a way to funnel riskless profits to banks.  (Of course, the RFC often replaced management, but things have gotten permissive as well as more sophisticated in recent decades.)   Which brings us back to Sumner and "all economic historians" being right, at least technically.  Yes, the currency was being devalued throughout much of 1933, but no, it wasn\'t.  Not really.  There were a series of fictional devaluations that served a specific purpose, but which nobody else made believe was real (and its possible which almost nobody else was aware were happening - don\'t ask me, I\'m not an economic historian).   Pretending otherwise, and using that fictional data to do an analysis is the equivalent of trying to understand the East German economy in 1974 using the exchange rates a traveler would have received at Checkpoint Charlie during that year.   * The title comes from a book put out by Mad Magazine in the 1970s or 1980s.

available for a full three months, an unexpected offer given the trend towards increased balance transfer fees following the recession. Credit cards with these attractive balance transfer offers are generally the least profitable for card issuers, and it had been years since any issuer took a big risk by offering a fee-free balance transfer. Today, Chase has also taken that leap of faith by offering the  Slate\xc2\xae from Chase \xe2\x80\x93 Limited Time: No Balance Transfer Fee  credit card offer. I expect this will only be available for a short time, so for anyone who has a high-APR balance on a credit card, this is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of a big discount on interest expenses.        The  Slate\xc2\xae from Chase \xe2\x80\x93 Limited Time: No Balance Transfer Fee  offer provides a 0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months.  This is offered only to applicants who have good or excellent credit. This deal is reserved for the best risks in the eyes of Chase; approved applicants with average credit will receive a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers for only six months.  All other card offers available publicly today come with a fee for balance transfers, usually 3 to 5 percent of the balance transferred. Chase is the only bank currently offering this perk, and this is the only Chase card for which the benefit is available. The 3 percent minimum balance transfer fee charged by other issuers cuts into the savings a balance transfer offer provides.    For example, a cardholder with a $10,000 balance looking for a lower interest rate transfers the entire balance to another credit card. With a 3 percent balance transfer fee, the new balance is already $10,300. With the Slate\xc2\xae from Chase \xe2\x80\x93 Limited Time: No Balance Transfer Fee, the new balance would remain $10,000, saving the customer $300 in comparison. The higher the balance transfer, the greater the potential savings.     Once the introductory rate expires, the standard purchase APR on the Slate\xc2\xae from Chase \xe2\x80\x93 Limited Time: No Balance Transfer Fee becomes 11.99%, 16.99% or 21.99% variable, depending on quality of credit history.  Chase does not charge an annual fee, so card holders who do not charge beyond their credit limits and who pay their bills on time will never pay Chase a dime for the privilege.     Citibank has been the leader of balance transfer offers, but this no balance transfer fee offer from Chase is putting pressure on Citi. Citi currently offers a  0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for 21 months  (with a 3% fee), so depending on how long a consumer needs to make interest free payments, the Slate from Chase could present a unique opportunity to save even more money.  Remember that this is a very limited time offer so to take advantage, apply for or review more information about the  Slate\xc2\xae from Chase \xe2\x80\x93 Limited Time: No Balance Transfer Fee  offer.

A group of Netflix customers have banded together to enter a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the two companies for this practice, which allegedly allowed Netflix to gain dominance and raise customers\xe2\x80\x99 fees.    Wal-Mart has agreed to settle the lawsuit. The company will pay a settlement fee of $27,250,000, with some of the proceeds going to affected customers. Netflix, on the other hand, has not yet stopped fighting the lawsuit.      You are included in the Wal-Mart settlement class if you live in the United States or Puerto Rico and you paid a subscription fee to Netflix to rent DVDs online anytime from May 19, 2005 through September 2, 2011. Any customer who had only a free Netflix trial does not qualify. You may receive a dollar or two from this settlement, but in order to receive your benefit, you must  file a claim . You can receive the payment in cash or a gift card.    The $27 million from Wal-Mart will be divided between lawyers, who will receive up to 25% of the payment plus additional costs of up to $1.7 million, administration expenses, and fees to class representatives at $5,000 a piece. The remainder will be divided equally between all settlement class members who file a claim. To get an idea of how many customers might need to split an estimated $18 million, Netflix had 24 million customers in the United States at the end of September.    Netflix is still fighting the lawsuit. They might eventually settle, and if they do, customers who would qualify for benefits include any person or entity in the United States that paid a subscription fee to Netflix anytime from May 19, 2005 to September 30, 2010. If there are benefits to receive, class members will not need to take any action. Any class members who would like to excise themselves from the lawsuit or potential settlement and reserve the right to sue Netflix regarding this issue will need to mail a letter to opt out.

The distinct parts of this process, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), are already in operation. But no one has yet joined them together on an industrial scale. So it was a blow when the government recently scrapped plans to build the country\xe2\x80\x99s first CCS unit at the Longannet coal-fired power station in Scotland, claiming it cost too much.

In reality, China is facing very difficult choices and is struggling to undo its previous decisions without destabilising the world's second-largest economy. Here (via Menzie Chinn) is Chinese macroeconomist Yu Yongding (apologies for long, but I think appropriate) block-quoting:It is clear that China should have brought to an end to the endless piling up of  foreign exchange reserves long time ago. There have been two basic  approaches for achieving this objective. The first approach is to reduce current  account surplus indirectly via narrowing the saving-investment gap. The  second one is to reduce current account surplus directly by dismantling trade  promotion policy, such as abolishing tax rebate and allowing renminbi to  appreciate. China has tried the two approaches at the same time with a very  cautious fashion. To reduce the saving gap by lowering the saving rate could  be an ideal solution. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, to achieve the  balance between saving and investment may take long time. By the time when  the Chinese economy has been rebalanced, no one ...   \r\n")

Mr Subramanian combines each country\xe2\x80\x99s share of world GDP, trade and foreign investment into an index of economic \xe2\x80\x9cdominance\xe2\x80\x9d. By 2030 China\xe2\x80\x99s share of global economic power will match America\xe2\x80\x99s in the 1970s and Britain\xe2\x80\x99s a century before. Three forces will dictate China\xe2\x80\x99s rise, Mr Subramanian argues: demography, convergence and \xe2\x80\x9cgravity\xe2\x80\x9d. Since China has over four times America\xe2\x80\x99s population, it only has to produce a quarter of America\xe2\x80\x99s output per head to exceed America\xe2\x80\x99s total output. Indeed, Mr Subramanian thinks China is already the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest economy, when due account is taken of the low prices charged for many local Chinese goods and services outside its cities. China will be equally dominant in trade, accounting for twice America\xe2\x80\x99s share of imports and exports. That projection relies on the \xe2\x80\x9cgravity\xe2\x80\x9d model of trade, which assumes that commerce between countries depends on their economic weight and the distance between them.   \r\n")

Envirosax \xc2\xa0are a practical, fashionable gift idea for your Secret Santa, stocking stuffers, teachers, volunteers, etc. The designer reusable bags are super durable and last for years (unlike those flimsy woven cloth bags you buy for $0.99).

They are washable, water resistant, and the colors won\xe2\x80\x99t fade.    Use them from the grocery store, to the beach, to a picnic in the park. What I love most about these is they roll into a tiny 4\xe2\x80\xb3 roll so you can easily store a couple extra bags in your purse. It also makes it easier while in the store as I never know what to do with my pile of other reusable bags while shopping. \xc2\xa0Tiny but strong, they can carry up to 44 lbs.

The damage, not just to Bank of America but to retail banking overall, has already been done. The Credit Union National Association has counted, state by state, a total of 650,000 new customers since September 29, the day Bank of America  announced its plan to begin this fee in 2012 .     While other banks had tested the debit card fee waters before Bank of America, this bank, the largest in the United States, was at the tipping point of an anti-Wall Street campaign. Reaction was vast, with thousands of dissatisfied customers \xe2\x80\x94 some with Bank of America, some with other mainstream banks \xe2\x80\x94 rallying around the creation of  Bank Transfer Day , on the calendar for this past Saturday.      Listen to the Consumerism Commentary Podcast interview with Kristen Christian, the founder of Bank Transfer Day.      This was good news for credit unions. Not including any new customers since last Wednesday, credit union membership increased at a record pace in the short time period of just over one month. With the 650,000 new customers, credit unions experienced an influx of $4.5 billion. The survey data come from a wide sample of 5,000 credit unions, 80 percent of which have seen a membership increase during this period. If Bank Transfer Day has been successful, the numbers should be even more impressive when NCUA includes the rest of the week\xe2\x80\x99s figures.    I did not yet move my accounts from my primary brick-and-mortar bank, Wells Fargo. I did, however, research credit unions for myself and discovered one that is somewhat convenient. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as convenient as the Wells Fargo branch down the street, the TD Bank branch in the other direction, or the Chase Bank within a short walking distance. With most of my banking online, a need for a convenient branch is less of an issue.     Did you move your money to a credit union in the last month? What was your experience?

Europe is undeniably in recession, the US is on the way, and Chinese manufacturing just entered contraction.      MarketWatch reports  China manufacturing gauge shows contraction     HSBC\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary China manufacturing survey fell to a 32-month low in November, well below analysts\xe2\x80\x99 forecasts, with the reading signaling the sector is now contracting.      The Purchasing Managers Index printed at 48.0 on a 100 point scale, reversing from a mildly expansionary reading of 51.0 in October, HSBC reported Wednesday.      Consensus forecasts for had called for a 50.1 result, just above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction, according to CNBC.       \xe2\x80\x9cAs inflation is likely to decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace, it will leave more room for Beijing to step up selective easing measures, which should gradually filter through to keep China on track for a soft landing,\xe2\x80\x9d HSBC economist Hongbin Qu said in comments accompanying the flash PMI release.   Soft-Landing Nonsense       Everyone is looking for the Fed, the ECB, and the Chinese Central Bank to steer the global economy to the proverbial "soft-landing".      Yet the fact remains, trillions of dollars have been spent already, hoping to forestall another recession. Every action has added to debt in the US, UK, Japan, and Europe, and created a huge inflationary construction boom in China.      Crude is still hugging $100 a barrel. Food prices are up. Is the Fed going to launch another round of QE into that? I doubt it. I doubt China does either, especially with a regime change coming up.      Is Congress going to approve stimulus changes that would help Obama get re-elected? The idea is laughable.       Crash Landing       Should central banks step in, watch for gold, crude, and oil prices to rise, and little else to happen. Central banks and world governments have applied so much totally useless Keynesian and Monetarist stimulus to prevent the inevitable, there may be no landing at all (soft or hard), until a global crash.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The Top Gun Options trading team believes this week could be one of those proverbial tipping points for Wall Street, as the eurozone\'s escalating sovereign debt crisis runs hard against a key deadline for the U.S. government\'s own debt issues. It\'s a stupid standoff.          Following directly on the heels of a very bad week for the equity market, when all of the major indices suffered some harsh drops, Congress is likely to announce that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which had been optimistically dubbed the "Super Committee," has failed in its mission to come up with a blueprint for cutting the deficit to the tune of over one trillion dollars. Wow...no one saw this coming. Shocker.                                                Exactly what the repercussions of this failure are remain to be seen, but there have been rumblings by the major rating agencies, including Moody\'s and Standard and Poor\'s, that the U.S. could see a further downgrade in its credit.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The Top Gun Options trading team believes this week could be one of those proverbial tipping points for Wall Street, as the eurozone\'s escalating sovereign debt crisis runs hard against a key deadline for the U.S. government\'s own debt issues. It\'s a stupid standoff.          Following directly on the heels of a very bad week for the equity market, when all of the major indices suffered some harsh drops, Congress is likely to announce that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which had been optimistically dubbed the "Super Committee," has failed in its mission to come up with a blueprint for cutting the deficit to the tune of over one trillion dollars. Wow...no one saw this coming. Shocker.                                                Exactly what the repercussions of this failure are remain to be seen, but there have been rumblings by the major rating agencies, including Moody\'s and Standard and Poor\'s, that the U.S. could see a further downgrade in its credit.

Kavanaugh\xe2\x80\x99s Strange Political Prediction\xe2\x80\x94And Other Recent ACA-Litigation Events     Well, as you all probably know by now, there have been two major developments in the courts within the last two weeks on the litigation challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA, a.k.a., \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare). On November 8, a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court for Washington, D.C. issued its ruling in a case challenging the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate requiring everyone who can afford healthcare insurance to purchase it, upon penalty of payment of a regulatory fee. That, of course, is the issue that has gotten almost all of the news media attention, thanks to loud Tea Party/Republican-pol/rightwing-talk-show-personalities cries that the mandate unconstitutionally violates individual liberty and therefore is beyond Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause.       The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and, under Supreme Court precedent, pretty much anything that affects interstate commerce. It is the \xe2\x80\x9cenumerated power\xe2\x80\x9d under which the ACA was enacted. As opposed to, say, the taxing \xe2\x80\x9cenumerated\xe2\x80\x9d power.     In several earlier AB posts , including one about the oral argument in late September in the appeal that was decided by last week\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, I said that the right-wing\xe2\x80\x99s conflation of the limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the Commerce Clause and the separate issue of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s various limitations on government power to infringe upon individual liberty, including in the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause limiting the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s powers to infringe upon individuals\xe2\x80\x99 rights, is a sophism, as a matter of law and as a matter of logic. I also said that the Due Process argument is fatuous; the federal government clearly has the authority under the  taxing  power to compel the purchase of medical insurance or retirement savings, and does so for Medicare and Social Security, and a mandate under the Commerce power infringes no more on individual liberty than a mandate under the taxing power.    I made these points originally in  an AB post in late June , a few days before Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a highly-regarded conservative Reagan appointee prominent Federalist Society member who early in his career served for a year as a law clerk to Justice Scalia, eloquently deconstructed that conflation in his 2-1 majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of individual mandate. I reiterated the points in an AB post  about  the Sutton opinion ( which I sillily titled \xe2\x80\x9cJudge Sutton Channels \xe2\x80\xa6 Me??\xe2\x80\x9d ). And I summarized them in  a post in early October  in which I discussed the oral argument in the appeal that was decided on November 8.  The Sixth Circuit opinion was the first appellate ruling on an ACA case. The dissenter in that opinion is not an appellate judge but instead a trial-level judge sitting on that appellate panel \xe2\x80\x9cby designation \xe2\x80\x9d of that court\xe2\x80\x99s chief judge via a statute that allows this, and whose dissenting opinion was breathtakingly lightweight.     In August, an Eleventh Circuit panel consisting of a Clinton appointee to the Court of Appeals who had been appointed as a trial-level judge by Reagan, another Clinton appointee, and a George H. W. Bush appointee, issued a 2-1 opinion ruling the individual-mandate provision unconstitutional but upholding the remainder of the ACA, saying that the remainder was \xe2\x80\x9cseverable\xe2\x80\x9d from the individual-mandate provision\xe2\x80\x94that is, that the remainder of the Act could stand on its own and that therefore the loss of the mandate provision did not dissolve the remainder of the statute. The opinion was written by the Reagan appointee, Joel Dubina and joined by Clinton appointee Frank Hull. Neither judge is considered a star legal analyst, and the opinion didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. It was a rote adoption of the the-individual-mandate-unconstitutionally-infringes-on-liberty-because-it-penalizes-inaction-and-therefore-Congress-exceded-its-Commerce-Clause-authority. The opinion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain how a supposed unconstitutional infringement of liberty amounts to a  per se  exceeding of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s  Commerce  power, the opinion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain. Alchemy? The dissent by Judge Stanley Marcus is scathing. (More about this case below.)  The panel in the Washington, D.C. case, the one decided on November 8, like the panel in the Sixth Circuit case, was comprised of two conservative Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee. Both Republican appointees, Lawrence Silberman and Brett Kavanaugh, the latter a former law clerk for Judge Kennedy, are high-profile stalwart conservatives and both are intellectual leaders of the \xe2\x80\x9cmovement\xe2\x80\x9d right, albeit from slightly different conservative-legal-movement eras. Silberman is a Reagan appointee, Kavanaugh a George W. Bush appointee. In any event, they are not just rightwing but also considered intelligent, if not necessarily by me.  In  my post last month about the oral argument  in that case, I wrote:   Sutton\xe2\x80\x99s analysis exposes the constitutional challenges to the individual mandate for what they are: a series of ideological clich\xc3\xa9s masquerading as legal argument.\xc2\xa0 As I wrote in AB shortly after the Sutton opinion was released, his analysis is so fine, so precise, that ultimately the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will echo it.\xc2\xa0 So I was not among those who were surprised that the administration is pushing for a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality or the statute before the 2012 election.\xc2\xa0 But all the judges thus far who have voted to invalidate the individual-mandate provision as unconstitutional are, in my opinion, intellectual lightweights, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d wondered whether the Sutton analysis itself could be persuasively deconstructed by a judge or justice who is not.     The answer appears to be no.\xc2\xa0 Last week, a panel of yet federal appellate court, this one the one for Washington, D.C., heard arguments in yet another case challenging the constitutionality of the mandate as beyond Congress\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce-regulation authority because it infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain self-insured, it requires the purchase of a \xe2\x80\x9cproduct\xe2\x80\x9d from a private party, and, well, um, the scope of the statute is really sweeping.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s next, asked one of the two stalwart rightwing-intellectual-heavyweight members of the panel?\xc2\xa0 Congress mandating the purchase of GM cars by the wealthy in order to prevent the collapse of that company during the next economic downturn, upon pain of payment of a penalty for failure to do so?\xc2\xa0 (I hope so. Then, when David Koch has a heart attack in his Maserati and the ambulance attendants verify through the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s offices in his various home states that there is no GM car registered in his name, the attendants dump his gasping-for-breath body in the road, where he\xe2\x80\x99s run over by a Cadillac SUV   I followed those paragraphs with this one:   A sigh of relief was in order\xe2\x80\x94although I had to wait until I stopped smiling like a Cheshire cat.\xc2\xa0 That judge, Brett Kavanaugh (a former law clerk to Justice Kennedy, circa 1993), reportedly commented earlier to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer that maybe the courts shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with what could be the beginning of the mass privatization of the social safety net.\xc2\xa0 More likely, I think, it will prompt, finally, a single-payer healthcare-insurance system\xe2\x80\x94Medicare for all\xe2\x80\x94in order to cut out the spiraling costs of a private, multi-carrier, for-profit system whose premiums reflect, in part the investment losses of those private companies.\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Judge Kavanaugh until after that appeal is over.   Um, oops. Actually, it was Silberman, not Kavanaugh, who suggested that if the individual mandate in the ACA is constitutional, then a mandate requiring the purchase of a GM car might be, too. It  was , however, Kavanaugh who predicted, mouth watering, that if the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is upheld, it might usher in a mass privatization of the social safety net.    When the panel decided the case, it was Silberman who wrote the opinion\xe2\x80\x94for himself and the Democratic appointee, liberal Clinton appointee Harry Edwards, upholding the individual mandate and echoing the basics of Judge Sutton\xe2\x80\x99s opinion: that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate that which affects an interstate market, as the healthcare market clearly is; that the decision to not purchase healthcare insurance is not inactivity but instead clearly market activity because (unlike the proverbial decisions whether to purchase broccoli, or a GM vehicle) virtually everyone will need healthcare at some point, and will receive it whether or not the person is insured or can afford to pay the medical bills out-of-pocket; that the infringement-of-individual-liberty objection is not a Commerce Clause issue but instead a Due Process issue; and that the individual-mandate provision does not unconstitutionally infringe upon individual liberty.    Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion adopts Sutton\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in all respects. Most interesting, I think\xe2\x80\x94partly, I guess, because by now I feel like I have a proprietary interest in it\xe2\x80\x94is his conclusion that:   Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that seems more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments. But it has no foundation in the Commerce Clause.   Kavanaugh dissented. But not on "liberty" grounds. And not even on Commerce Clause grounds. Instead, he said a court ruling now is premature, for two reasons., one (he said) compelled by statute, the other (he said) in deference to "the bedrock principle of judicial restraint that courts avoid prematurely or unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions."     "Unnecessarily" being the interesting part of this.     The statutory reason is his interpretation of a federal court-jurisdiction statute called the Anti-Injunction Act and of the legal nature of the mandate provision. The Anti-Injunction Act removes the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., legal authority, of the courts to even consider the challenge to the individual-mandate provision and its penalty for failure to purchase insurance until after the effective date of that provision in 2014 and the penalty is assessed against someone who then sues for reimbursement, contesting the provision\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality. The issue depends on whether the penalty is a  tax , since the Anti-Injunction Act applies only to taxes. In August, a panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, 2-1, that the mandate is a tax and that the Act therefore removed the courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the mandate provision until 2015, when the first penalties would be assessed by the I.R.S. Kavanaugh bought the argument; Silberman and Edwards didn\xe2\x80\x99t.     The \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d reason has subparts, but the main ones are that Congress may repeal the ACA, or parts of it, before the individual-mandate provision becomes effective, and, more to the point (or at least more to  my  point), that Congress may instead simply change the wording of the mandate provision slightly so that the penalty is clearly a tax. Which, he says, clearly would be constitutional.    He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say that it would be clearly within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power. He says, flatly, that it would be clearly constitutional. He says, in other words, that the infringement on liberty does not itself violate the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94whether the mandate is an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to regulate interstate commerce or instead an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.    That Kavanaugh has an ideological ulterior motive which advertised at oral argument and reiterates with more elaboration in his dissenting opinion\xe2\x80\x94 his expectation that if the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is upheld, it could herald an era of mass privatization of the social safety net, happily marrying tea party types and rightwing interests in having government create a market serving private business interests\xe2\x80\x94does not matter. Nor does it matter that Kavanaugh is delusional\xe2\x80\x94unless, of course, it really is likely that there is, say, a private-food-assistance lobby similar in number to the insurance-industry lobby that, like the insurance-industry lobby did in fighting single-payer healthcare insurance proposals (and even the so-called public option in a version of Obamacare) , will emerge like locusts to have Congress enact a law mandating that everyone who can afford to do so must purchase food stamps each year, redeemable when and if necessary. Or that the AARP will agitate for privatization of Social Security, maybe in order to prevent the government from funding massive otherwise-unfunded wars and massive tax cuts for the wealthy largely by tapping the ostensible Social Security trust fund.    No, what matters is that Kavanaugh said what he said, irrespective of his motive. Kavanaugh got it right. The individual-mandate provision does not violate the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on government infringement of individual liberty. And Sutton and Silberman, neither of whom appears to share Kavanaugh\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar delusion and ulterior motive, but also neither of whom voted for Obama or any member of Congress who voted for his \xe2\x80\x9ccare,\xe2\x80\x9d have enunciated so finely why this is so and why, also, the mandate provision is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause authority, that a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling to the contrary would be a transparent act of ideology. It\xe2\x80\x99s not, of course, that the majority doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do this, regularly; they do. It\xe2\x80\x99s that this time they would be eating not only Obama and Care, but also Kavanaugh, Sutton and Silberman.    The fat lady hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sung yet on the constitutionality of the individual mandate, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s over nonetheless. When the Court decides that issue\xe2\x80\x94and despite the out-of-right-field potential inherent in certain sort-of-breathtaking parts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s order last Monday agreeing to hear the Eleventh Circuit case\xe2\x80\x94I think the Court  will  decide that issue, eventually, if not in that case.    For the specifics of that order, and a comprehensive discussion of the five parts to it and the possible implications of one of them, see Simon Lazarus and Dahlia Lithwick\xe2\x80\x99s article in Slate, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Medicaid Ambush: The Supreme Court\'s unexpected and astounding reasons for wanting to hear a challenge to Obamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d  here  .              If the Court rules the ACA unconstitutional because the majority thinks the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s expansion-of-Medicaid provision violates the states\xe2\x80\x99, um, constitutional right to the current federal statutory entitlement (Medicaid in its current form) in order to protect the popularity of the states\xe2\x80\x99 legislators who would vote to forego Medicaid in order to avoid the requirements of Obamacare (see the Slate article), then of course the Court will never have to decide the constitutionality of the individual mandate. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will buy the states\xe2\x80\x99 hubristic claim; I think the Court simply wants to hear all challenges from all governments that are suing. This is a court with at least a few members who apparently think that any time a state or local government asks it to hear a case, it should hear the case. But it also is a court whose majority, in deciding cases, regularly privileges the states\xe2\x80\x99 interests over the interests of the federal government and of individuals. Their ideology largely rejects the Fourteenth Amendment and the original Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Supremacy Clause. So, who knows?    As for what caused Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s change of heart about whether the individual mandate unconstitutionally infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain uninsured, I have two theories. One is that Kavanaugh read my AB post attributing to him Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s oral argument comment equating the mandate with a theoretical mandate to purchase a GM car, and after explaining to Silberman the difference between the two and insisting that Silberman publicly clarify the distinction or make clear that he, not Kavanaugh, drew the analogy, lest a gasping-for-air David Koch be dumped by an ambulance attendant onto the street and run over by a Cadillac Escalade and that Kavanaugh be blamed, he persuaded Silberman to change his mind about the whole analogy. The other is that Silberman himself gave more thought to whether it would be such a bad thing after all for the government to mandate a GM car in every driveway. After all, that new Chevy Cruze is awfully cute and gets pretty good gas mileage.       \r\n')

The sheer quantity, speed, beauty, complexity and sophistication of new visualisation techniques are amazing. But they are still susceptible to the prosaic deceptions of data displays such as scale, aspect ratio and placement.  In addition, intensive processing for visualisation can actually destroy information. Some methods average data-points across vast reaches of time, space and magnitude. Many techniques destroy the natural variation in the data and treat outliers as anomalies to be edited or ignored. Our knowledge of physical and economic reality requires that we understand both variability and extremes.

This undisputed genius, who lived to be 67, was also one of history\xe2\x80\x99s most accomplished underachievers. He started many projects he did not finish; he accepted commissions he never began; his many planned treatises remained just notes. Only 18 of his paintings survive. Half of them are included in a show that opened on November 9th at London\xe2\x80\x99s National Gallery, making this the most important da Vinci display ever.The artist was born near Florence in 1452 and went to Milan at the age of 30. Luke Syson, the show\xe2\x80\x99s curator, has come to believe that the freedom da Vinci enjoyed there as court painter to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, was the key that unlocked his genius.Mr Syson\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Leonardo\xe2\x80\x99s great breakthrough came in Milan and not later in Florence, as has generally been accepted until now, has captivated curators, collectors and museum directors who have been generous in loaning works to the show; from the Vatican, Prague, Cracow, Paris and the Royal Collection.All the pictures on show were painted during da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s 18 years in Milan. Never has it been possible to see so many of da Vinci\xe2\x80\x99s paintings together....    \r\n')

A lot of this research focuses on the \xe2\x80\x9ctit-for-tat\xe2\x80\x9d theory of co-operation: that humans are disposed, when dealing with another person, to behave in a generous manner until that other person shows himself not to be generous. At this point co-operation is withdrawn. Fool me once, in other words, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.When he encounters such a withdrawal of collaboration, the theory goes, the malefactor will learn the error of his ways and become a more co-operative individual. And there is experimental evidence, based on specially designed games, that tit-for-tat does work for pairs of people. Human societies, though, are more complex than mere dyads. And until recently, it has been difficult to model that complexity in the laboratory. But a paper published this week in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by Nicholas Christakis and his colleagues at Harvard has changed that. Dr Christakis arranged for a collaboration-testing game to be played over the web, with many participants. As a result, he and his team have gained a more sophisticated insight into the way co-operation develops.Dr Christakis used what is known as a public-goods game for his experiment.

After all, shareholders in publicly traded financial institutions cheered them on as they boosted their short-term profits and share prices by taking risky bets with enormous amounts of borrowed money. Those bets, it turns out, did terrible damage in the longer term, to the firms and their shareholders as well as to the economy as a whole. Shareholders can no longer with a straight face cite the efficient-market hypothesis as evidence that rising share prices are always evidence of better prospects, rather than of an unsustainable bubble.  If the stockmarket can get wildly out of whack in the short run, companies and investors ...   \r\n")

But after the leaking in September of an explosive report from this unit detailing cost overruns totalling hundreds of millions of dollars, kickbacks and illegal donations to political parties, Mr Charest relented.On October 19th he said that he had asked France Charbonneau, a superior-court judge, to probe financial ties between construction firms and political parties dating back 15 years. Judge Charbonneau is a tough former prosecutor.

The question has been whether he can stare down his own allies, those unions, and pass the necessary reform.Mr Brown has now released a plan. Initial reactions suggest that he may pass his test: the unions were outraged, many Democratic legislators (often beholden to the unions) felt awkward, and several Republican legislators were supportive.

Via email, Steen writes ...    We have a new stress high in our indicators. Core Europe is under pressure.      In Europe the two new Super technocrats (Papademos and Monti) meets with EU officials over the course of next two days. Expect \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance\xe2\x80\x9d to be the buzz-word, but  Greek opposition party chief resists EU/IMF pressure on pledge : \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6there is no need to provide written guarantee because his word can be trusted\xe2\x80\x9d      There is rising concern about Greece, and with S&amp;P down nearly 19 points on the open of Europe, it looks like a new level of alertness.      So keep an eye out on ECB and its now massive support program \xe2\x80\x93 below is the Gross amount bought \xe2\x80\x93 the key this week is last week intervention size.      Safe travels,      Steen Jakobsen  |  Chief Economist  ECB Securities Markets Programme (Bond Purchases\xe2\x80\x8e) in Millions of Euros                That\'s quite a bit given the ECB\'s insistence it will not be a lender of last resort.      Last week there was much ado over nothing when the ECB said it would "limit" the amount of purchases to 20 billion Euros a week. The interventionists all complained.       Did anyone bother to do the math on that? 20 billion euros * 52 = 1.04 trillion Euros and interventionists screamed bloody murder.       Reuters says  ECB keeps handbrake on as bond buys hit 8 billion euros .       Handbrake Math, Intervention Math       8 billion euros * 52 = 416 billion Euros, nearly as big as the EFSF.      Moral of the story: There is never enough intervention to suit interventionists.      Why?      Intervention never works. All it can do is create a bigger problem elsewhere.       Stress Indicators        Meanwhile please ponder these charts from Saxo Bank that form the basis of Steen\'s assertion "We have a new stress high in our indicators."       click on any chart for sharper image         France - Germany 10-Year Government Bond Spread                 Italy and Belgium 5-Year US$ CDS                 Italy and Greece Demand Deposits                 Denmark - Germany 10-Year Government Bond Spread                    Euro Basis 3-Month Swaps                 Money Market Warning Signals       On November 3, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that will help explain the significance of Euro Basis Swaps. Please consider  Three-Month Euro Dollar Cross Currency Basis Swap Widens     Swapping euros into dollars is becoming extremely expensive, according to a leading indicator that is at its widest level since December 2008.      The three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap is at minus 118 basis points versus minus 102 basis points on Wednesday. That\'s still shy of the minus-215 level it reached amid the financial turmoil of October 2008, but the indicator is now trading at levels where bankers say it is flashing warning signals about the functioning of money markets.      The debt crisis in Europe has created stronger demand for dollars, making it more pricey to get access to such funding. Banks and other firms that operate globally and need dollars have had limited access to the greenback, as investors have been wary of lending to them, so they have been relying more heavily on the euro-dollar swap market to meet their financing needs. This route has become increasingly more costly for them.       Traders say the three-month cross currency basis swap is showing greater stress than the one year swap because borrowers want to fund themselves past the end of the year. They also do not want to be seen as leaning on central banks for long-term funding, which is an option for them.  The Euro Basis 3-Month Swap continues to widen, a clear sign of increasing stress.

Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana has come up with what she's called the Airline Passenger Basic Airline Standards to Improve Customer Satisfaction (BASICS) Act, which would require airlines to allow passengers one checked and one carry-on bag for free. The second piece of legislation that Landrieu intends to introduce is the Fair Airline Industry Revenue (FAIR) Act, which would impose additional fees on airlines that don't comply.      Explains the Senator, who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Homeland Security:    When an airline advertises a flight, that is how much it should cost, plain and simple. Passengers should not be charged additional fees for checked or carry-on baggage, drinkable water or other reasonable requests....       Many airlines consider checking a bag not to be a right, but a privilege - and one with a hefty fee attached. The Airline Passenger BASICS Act will guarantee passengers one checked bag without the financial burden of paying a fee, or the headache of trying to fit everything into a carry-on       It will be interesting to see if this legislation actually has some legs or if it will just go around and round, like some unclaimed luggage on the carousel.     \r\n")

work, and rising bootstraps,   Peter Dorman at  Econospeak  replies in:   Education with a Twist\xe2\x80\x94An Oliver Twist"       "why take it out on the janitors? If the school was failing it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their fault. According to Gingrich, it\xe2\x80\x99s the teachers who can\xe2\x80\x99t make the grade. So why not put the kids to work following lesson plans, going over last year\xe2\x80\x99s standardized tests, etc.? There would be as much pride in this as in cleaning toilets."     Usually when we focus on schools, the focus is on the failing city school model, teachers, and then the students themselves. One commenter draws the following conclusion:      "I spent weekend pass time as an English conversation resource person at a high school in Taejon. I was able to have a first-hand look at how education was done in what was at that time a very poor country with big ambitions. Most villages at that time were without running water or electricity and people still wore the traditional clothing, both men and women. There was no doubt that we were in a foreign country.    Because there was not enough money to provide free public education to everyone, students had to pass examinations starting with what we would call middle school if they were to be allowed to continue. Same for high school and, of course, post-secondary education.        Those who could not pass the tests were not accepted. But some children of families with enough money were able to continue their education through private schools. The system was exactly opposite what I had seen in America where private schools were generally the place where many of the most accomplished students were sent."     and another:     "The idea seems to be to give the kids some kind of work other than school work; and to build up a work ethic, which could well be more valuable to them than academics if they are in such a dire situation. I know that a friend of mine who runs a small business says he finds it very hard to hire for low end jobs: too many of his new employees don\'t really "get" the whole work concept      I expect anybody who comments here is probably at least middle class. The work ethic is something our parents drilled into us by example and through discipline. That\'s unfortunately not true for a lot of the poor, and it is one reason they have so much trouble improving their lot."     Is it really the student\'s fault or have we just taken our own fifties, sixties, and seventies values and applied them to a dysfunctional economy and educational system believing there is still a ray of hope if one works hard enough they can still pull themselves up by their boot straps?    Maybe it is true that Korea has been able to lift the boat of equality for all of it students; but then too when all are at the same level of, efforts to lift the outcome are equally divided and not skewed toward the suburbs over the inner cities. Review the difference in tax revenues for Detroit as compared to Rochester Hills, Farmington Hills, etc. if you wish to see inequality. One way to fix the problem is for Detroit to annex the suburbs to provide a better tax base. It is no longer a society which provides an equal chance to all people and the chance for upward mobility we used to experience in the sixties, seventies and eighties is long gone. Tom Hertz does a nice study defining upward mobility in a short study: "Understanding Upward Mobility in America." The days when a good work ethic and a high school diploma being the ticket to the middle class have also disappeared. I am sure you would not solely blame the high unemployment percentage rates on those with just a high school education on a lack of work ethic? And what of college with the high costs of student loans to finance college which has certainly contributed to closing the door on many. I suspect the Korean Vet went to college on the GI Bill the same as I and when it paid for tuition. Loyola of Chicago used to be ~$300 a course in the Masters Program. I am sure it is more now. Dr. Elizabeth Warren reviews what has happened to the chances to enter the middle class; " The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class."   Why is it we are willing to finance prisons at an average $24,000 per prisoner and keep captive ~1% of the total adult population, heavily skewed towards minorities, with ~50% being nonviolent, and yet we quibble over financing public schools? Is that expenditure for prisoners reaping a better result? Maybe we should teach high school students to be prison guards as it is a growing business both private and public. Another good and not a terribly long read is Dr. James Gillian " Violence: Reflections on A National Epidemic. " A lack of chance in upward mobility with this generation and the previous ones will result in other economic consequences.  "Are there No Prisons??? Are there No Union Workhouses???       \r\n')

(My most recent post on the issue is  here .)  In private correspondence, Sumner provided me with the draft for three chapters of a manuscript he is working on.  I can safely say that whether or not I agree with his findings, Sumner has done his homework - the draft is meticulously researched and abounds with details corroborating his findings.  Of particular interest to me was a Table 8.2, which shows weekly figures for a number of series from April 15, 1933 to the first week of February, 1934.  Sumner has graciously agreed to let me post that table.  I don\'t want to freeride on his efforts to much, so I\'m only reproducing the first few columns.       Figure 1  I believe the most interesting thing in the table is - what has been the cause of some discussion between the two of us - is the Gold Index.  From the footnote to the table in the manuscript:   The gold index is the Annualist Index of Commodity Prices measured in gold terms.     Sumner collected that data manually from old trade journals.  I haven\'t been able to find that data online.  What the data shows, to quote Sumner, is that "an ounce of gold could buy more internationally traded goods in 1934 than 1933.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what the 815 to 650 is showing\xe2\x80\x94falling prices in gold terms."

It has produced a string of scientific achievements: confirming that most galaxies have a black hole in the middle; providing a front-row seat for the collision, in 1994, of a comet with the planet Jupiter; and helping to uncover the strange fact that the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating.

Its beautiful images have introduced a generation to the wonders of astronomy.So in 2002, when the agency considered plans for a successor that would study the universe in infra-red, rather than visible light, would be ready to fly in 2010 and would cost just $2.5 billion, saying \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d was easy.

These developments create an incredibly convenient way to take your paycheck into the store, have it cashed at the Money Center, and use your cash for your shopping trip. With Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s trend to become a one-stop shop for all household needs, including groceries, each Wal-Mart location is becoming its own small mall \xe2\x80\x94 or even village.    The Wal-Mart Money Centers are not full banks. They offer check cashing services, bill payments, outgoing wires, and reloadable debit cards. There are no checking accounts or savings accounts. Wal-Mart abandoned its plans to become a bank, and in doing so, is able to offer certain financial services while not being held to the same regulations as Chase, Bank of America, or your local bank branch. On the spectrum of financial institutions, Wal-Mart Money Centers are closer to establishments like payday loan companies and check cashing storefronts, who charge high fees and cater to lower-income communities and the unbanked population, than the centers are to banks.      Check cashing fee.  The good news is that the fees for cashing your paycheck or government check are generally much lower than the fees at shadier establishments. At the Wal-Mart Money Center, you can cash your check for a 1 percent fee with a maximum fee of $3. Of course, you can cash your checks for free at a bank.      Prepaid debit card fee.  The fee to reload and maintain your  prepaid debit card  is lower than fees for prepaid debit cards elsewhere. Wal-Mart uses GreenDot prepaid debit cards, but at reduced rates of $3 to load and $3 per month to maintain. This is a system designed to charge people with low credit scores or a poor history with banks fees to use their own money. These are fees that middle-income banking customers doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to pay, particularly now that  big banks have backed away from charging monthly debit card fees .    According to Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s own survey, 60 percent of the customers using the Money Center have bank accounts. These customers are most likely more interested in the convenience, and willing to accept the fees in exchange for getting access to their money at the same location they shop. The remaining 40 percent must be the reason Wal-Mart chose to offer its own check cashing service rather than extending a potentially lucrative contract to a bank that could theoretically operate a branch in every Wal-Mart location.     Are these new services good for the people of Wal-Mart? I\xe2\x80\x99m having trouble finding a significant drawback. I believe it would be better if Wal-Mart were to offer more traditional banking services, but this system is more profitable. The temptation to spend more money when you receive cash from your employer\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck in the store where you\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending money could be an invitation to spend more than necessary, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re spending with cash, at least you\xe2\x80\x99ll be limited to spending only what you have on hand. At the same time, Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s Money Centers offer a better choice than payday loans and check cashing storefronts for lower-income families or the 40 percent of customers who do not have bank accounts, and could possibly help these households transition to a bank in the future.     I do not see Wal-Mart centers as an alternative to banks for most existing banking customers. There is anger towards Wall Street and the banking system, and initiatives like  Bank Transfer Day  encourage people to move away from the big banks towards credit unions and community banks. The Wal-Mart Money Center is not a replacement for a big bank, and moving a family from managing finances through a bank to managing finances on an all-cash basis through an outfit like these could be detrimental to long-term financial stability.

Two banks had tightened conditions.The retrenchment in bank lending in America is small relative to that in Europe, which will help push the euro zone into recession and place pressure on its banking systems. Here is more interesting reading on ECB purchases of sovereign debt and the approaching threshold for sterilsation operations. I have to say, I'm puzzled. Recent developments in the euro zone seem incredibly negative to me. The probability of a reasonably orderly conclusion of the crisis appears to be falling. Yet equities aren't dropping; indeed, they're up from early September. Has the roadrunner sprinted off the cliff but not yet looked down? Or am I missing something?UPDATE: As commenters point out, I was dreadfully off in suggesting that the roadrunner may have run off a cliff rather than the coyote. Sincere apologies.   \r\n")

He never quite got the hang of it, only to be rescued by the digital age. Now, though, researchers led by Jeff Yan, of Newcastle University, have found that loops and crosses may prove critical online, too. In a paper co-authored with two colleagues he shows how these caligraphic fripperies can unlock the visual puzzle dubbed the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, but better known as CAPTCHAs.  The term CAPTCHA was coined in 2000 by Luis van Ahn and his fellow academics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The idea was to stop spammers (and later criminals) creating accounts through which they could join forums and send e-mail by imposing a hurdle that would be tough for computers, but easy for human beings to scale. (This newspaper discussed the squiggles and potential future replacements in depth in 2009.)  Dr Yan\'s group looked at a popular CAPTCHA technique known as "crowding characters together" (CCT) in which letters simply overlap. CCTs were considered a hard computer science problem, and no algorithm had yet been capable of disentagling the twists and skews of layered text, whereas the human visual cortex performs the task swiftly.

spotlight on several countries, none of the typical culprits.       Hungary Seeks Aid From EU, IMF        The Wall Street Journal reports  Hungary Seeks Aid From EU, IMF     The European Commission said Monday that it has received a formal request from Hungary to receive financial assistance from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.      "The Commission will examine the authorities\' request in close consultation with EU member states and the IMF," the commission, which has antitrust powers in the EU, said in a statement.      In a separate statement, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde also said it has "received a request from the Hungarian authorities for possible financial assistance."      The ministry said it expects to start the negotiations before Christmas, with a new agreement to be concluded in the initial months of 2012. It didn\'t disclose details on the nature of the requested IMF support. The government would seek a deal with the IMF on an insurance contract to reassure investors and to allow Hungary to raise the capital it needs, it said.      No Government in Belgium Since June 2010, Negotiator Quits       Belgium is still without a government and has been since June 2010. Every time there has been a hint of a breakthrough, the setup collapses. Fed up with lack of progress, the  Belgian chief government negotiator asks to quit     BRUSSELS: The lead negotiator in Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s drawn-out government formation tendered his resignation on Monday after talks for a 2012 budget ground to a halt, a move which threatened to derail the country\xe2\x80\x99s near 18-month search for a new administration.      Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, had attempted to form a government based on a six-party coalition of Dutch and French-speaking Socialists, Liberals and Christian Democrats but there was little common ground on how to make the budget cuts mandated by the European Union.      Parties in the debt-heavy country had sought to save 11.3 billion euros and keep the country\xe2\x80\x99s deficit below 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), in line with EU rules, but could not agree how to divide the deficit reduction between new taxes and savings.      When the budget talks, which are essential to the formation of a new government, made no progress on Monday, Di Rupo handed in his resignation to the country\xe2\x80\x99s monarch, King Albert II.        Di Rupo handed in his resignation once before, in July, when talks over the electoral boundaries collapsed. At that stage the palace did not accept his resignation and talks resumed shortly after.      Belgium has come under market pressure over its lack of a new government and sovereign debt nearly as big as its GDP, with its cost of borrowing increasing steadily. Spreads between Belgian 10-year bonds and benchmark German Bunds rose sharply in November, going above 300 basis points, up from 103 basis points at the start of 2011.      Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s interim government, headed by Yves Leterme, is preparing an emergency budget, based on the 2011 budget.  Austrian Banks to Limit Lending to East       The Financial Times reports  Austrian Banks\xe2\x80\x89 Told to Limit Lending to East     Austrian bank supervisors have instructed the country\xe2\x80\x99s banks to limit future lending in their east European subsidiaries, a further sign of the potential knock-on effects of the eurozone crisis for economies around the world.      The restrictions come as Austrian officials seek to defend the country\xe2\x80\x99s AAA credit rating, amid concerns that the government might have to bail out its banks because of losses in central and eastern Europe, where they are the biggest lenders, and their exposure to Italy.       The moves by Austria, which appear to be unilateral, show how even the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s strongest economies are feeling the pressure of the sovereign debt crisis.      The Austrian central bank said in a statement that Erste Group, Raiffeisen Bank International and Bank Austria, owned by UniCredit of Italy, would be prevented from loaning significantly more in CEE countries than what they raise in local deposits. Subsidiaries that are \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly exposed\xe2\x80\x9d must ensure the ratio of new loans to local refinancing is not more than 110 per cent.      The three banks\xe2\x80\x99 CEE exposure exceeds Austrian GDP, raising concerns that the government would be unable to bail them out if their loan portfolios turned sour. The announcement came just as the spreads of Austrian bond yields over German Bunds rose to record highs and was also designed to calm market jitters, a central bank official said. A quick check of  Belgium 10-year government bonds  shows the yield has risen to 4.87% vs. 1.91% for Germany.

Google is the overwhelmingly dominant online connection for customers to business. This dominance, along with its restrictions on access to YouTube and its book-scanning project, are real causes of concern, not least to artists, authors and other content creators.     Google uses Universal Search to leverage its dominance in a panoply of online markets, including video, e-commerce, vertical search, mobile and social media. This follows a spate of strategic acquisitions that has rightly attracted regulatory interest because of the destructive impacts on competitors in each market.

Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s column looks at the role of spirituality within the context of personal finance. For an introduction to this column, see Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s first article,  The Pastor and the Purse . Your feedback is welcome.     It\xe2\x80\x99s time for a little geography lesson.    Look at the tag in your pants. Right there, below the strict instructions not to put them in the drier, which you, like me, probably ignore, it tells you where your pants were born. \xe2\x80\x9cMade in Mauritius,\xe2\x80\x9d my pants tell me.  The magic Interwebs let me know that this is a tiny island nation off the southeast coast of Africa.     Now I am curious. Because in my experience, small island nations don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily fare well where clothing manufacturing is concerned. So even though a part of me doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to know\xe2\x80\xa6I check on the labor practices of the manufacturer. The results are  not encouraging .      This means I will have to find a different source of pants. And since I\xe2\x80\x99ve raised the question of ethics in manufacturing, it also means I\xe2\x80\x99m more likely to intentionally seek out brands of clothing that have higher standards.  Oh, sure, I could shrug and try to forget I ever looked that up, or pretend that sweatshop labor does not clash with my values at all\xe2\x80\xa6 but it does. And I did. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. Once you know something, you can\xe2\x80\x99t un-know it.    Most of us move through our consumer lives in blissful ignorance. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where our clothing, gadgets, trinkets come from, and frankly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t care. We just want them to look good, work well, and entertain us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know about  child labor  or  sweatshop labor  or  toxins . Because if we knew \xe2\x80\x94 if we really allowed ourselves to open our eyes and see the truth, and to notice the places where this truth grates against our most deeply-held truths \xe2\x80\x94 then we would  have to change.     Ignorance isn\xe2\x80\x99t really bliss. It\xe2\x80\x99s just ignorance. As a society, we would never tolerate knowing nothing about where our food comes from. We want some reasonable assurance that it is safe to eat, that it will nourish us, that it is what it says it is. Why would we deliberately embrace ignorance when it comes to materials, labor conditions and sources of other consumer goods? After all, those are real human beings on the other end of our supply chain. To pretend otherwise is not only ignorance, but dangerous.    In some ways, this is the essence of any spiritual path. It is about taking the teachings and values of that path, and aligning your real, everyday life with them. This includes what we do, what we say, how we treat people, and what and how we consume. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy, and no one does it perfectly, but we can all start where we are. I can start with my next grocery trip, or the next time I need new socks. I can start with rearranging my investment portfolio, or I can start by exploring fair trade gifts for this holiday season.  Here, at the intersection of soul and money, there are hard questions to be asked.  If I am who I say I am, what must I do?      What consumer goods do you research from a values perspective?  What do you wish you could evaluate from that perspective, but don\xe2\x80\x99t know how? What would you prefer to remain totally ignorant about? Are there any \xe2\x80\x9clines in the sand\xe2\x80\x9d for you, issues or practices that you absolutely do not tolerate in your consumer choices?

Britain is Europe\xe2\x80\x99s biggest toy market, followed by France and Germany, according to Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9rique Tutt, an analyst at NPD EuroToys. British parents buy an average of 41 toys per year, which is almost a toy per week. In Spain, by contrast, children receive few toys outside the Christmas season.Less encouragingly, Britons seem highly susceptible to media conglomerates\xe2\x80\x99 marketing campaigns.

If you do agree with this statement, according to a new study released by Brigham Young University and William Paterson University, you would be more likely to score highly in measurements of emotional maturity and responsiveness to partners. In other words, less materialistic people are happier in their marriages.      According to the study, researchers tend to believe that stress in relationships is a result of each partner having a different attitude toward money. Perhaps one side of the relationship is more materialistic than the other side, and this divergence of attitudes would create tension in the relationship. This study, which surveyed 1,734 married couples, shows that even when everyone within the relationship has the same attitude towards money \xe2\x80\x94 an attitude that emphasizes the importance of money and things \xe2\x80\x94 there is a correlation to a lower level of marital happiness or satisfaction.    These results can be applied to couples. For a better chance of happiness in a relationship, let go of the focus on money, particularly the idea that the purpose of money is to accumulate objects that reflect a status of some sort.     The study further concluded that even if one member of the couple lived by a philosophy not based on the accumulation of material objects, the relationship is better off from a satisfaction standpoint. Even if the philosophies differ and the couple would be expected to live in conflict over the philosophical divergence, having just one member willing to look beyond materialism correlates to more marital bliss.    Regardless of level of income, the correlation continues. Couples struggling to make ends meet and couples with financial security are both affected similarly by the state of materialistic attitudes in the relationship. The study also shows that materialistic couples tend to be better off financially. The philosophy may pay off from a strictly financial standpoint; then again, divorces can be costly and could negate any financial advantage gained by approaching life with a focus on buying more stuff.    Materialism, as measured by this survey, is linked to  ineffective communication with the significant other , increased negative conflict, and decreased satisfaction and stability in the relationship. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship. The study doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show that materialism  causes  problems in a relationship, but there is a correlation. There could be an outside variable that induces one to be more materialistic and induces one to tend towards negative conflict.     Is the financial advantage of being overly concerned about money and things worth the risk of being less satisfied in a marriage?

" Fortunate Fool " writes ...    Hello Mish      Vancouver is a different world. To truly appreciate it, let me give you an example. In a normal world, if you had bought a house in April 2004 for $6 million, how much would you put it for sale today? Hard to say right? Let say your house value increased with an inflation at 2% per year, that would be roughly $6.9 million. In the current economic situation, you would be happy to get that money back.       In Vancouver, it\'s different. If you bought at that price in 2004, you would put it back on the market in 2010 for... $17.9 million! A compounded return of 20% a year. But there is a problem, it turns out that you couldn\'t sell the property. So in that case, what would you do? You would decrease the price, right?       Wrong! Remember, you are in Vancouver, and it\'s different there. No, you would put the property back on the market for... $31.9 million! (a 78% increase from last year\'s price or an expected annual compounded rate of return of 27%).      Repeat after me. No, Vancouver is not in a bubble.  Fortunate Fool backs up his claim with this article from the Vancouver Sun:  Vancouver mansion for sale: $31.9 million     A house has just gone on the market at 3390 The Crescent in Shaughnessy for $31.9 million. That may sound like a lot of money, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the highest listing price in Metro Vancouver \xe2\x80\x94 a house at 2190 Camelot in West Vancouver is for sale at $39.9 million. And has been, for several months.      High-end homes like this often take a while to sell, because once you get into the tens of millions, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many buyers. In fact, the $31.9-million Shaughnessy home was for sale last year for $17.9 million, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell.      Property records list the owners as K. Fan Hiu and H.F. Chi, who purchased the home in April 2004 for $6 million. Ted Wang of Royal Pacific Realty said the couple have decided to downsize to an apartment.      Wang said the owners decided to raise the listing price after looking at the high prices mansions are commanding in Shaughnessy. He noted that a house he sold last year on Angus Drive for $5.7 million was recently assessed at $9 million.  It\'s Different in Bizarro World       The owners upped their price from $17.9 million (offered just last year) to $31.9 million, an increase of 78%, because they want to " downsize to an apartment ".      This of course makes perfect sense because " It\'s different in Bizarro World " just as it is in Vancouver.      Inquiring minds may be interested in the " Complete History of Bizarro World " from Superman to Seinfeld to Saturday Night Live.      We can safely add Vancouver to the list.

The effort has been tricky: There were non-legal challenges, too. For example, until 1941 German  books were typically set in a blackletter type style known as Fraktur,  and sometimes mistakenly called Gothic. (Fraktur was banned in 1941 by  Hitler's secretary, Martin Bormann, for being too Jewish.) The intricate  black-letter face can be difficult for modern readers to decipher. It  was a tough ask for modern optical-character-recognition software, too,  which had to be trained to accommodate it. On top of that, the  dictionaries used by the software needed to be supplemented with  obsolete words that were commonly used in the 19th century.One small and clearly annoying step for digitising software, but a giant leap for reader access.

Euro-zone governments continue to tumble; Spain forcefully ejected its Socialist government on Sunday. Its recent rule coincided with economic collapse, rising unemployment, and round after round of austerity, as the government sought to get ahead of the debt crisis. The new government's large majority will give it more room to manage an unmanageable crisis. Spanish yields are rising today, along with those of Italy. The crisis is beyond the power of individual governments to solve on their own; coordination is key.Which makes one piece of news out of Brussels today seem at least somewhat auspicious. The European Commission has put together a white paper, to be released this week, proposing the creation of euro bonds. It appears that three different options are discussed, moving along the spectrum of shared risk. In those least ambitious version, the combined governments of the euro zone would provide some guarantee for the newly issued bonds of national governments. In the most ambitious scheme, the euro zone would approve individual budgets, which would be financed through euro bonds.

Euro-zone governments continue to tumble; Spain forcefully ejected its Socialist government on Sunday. Its recent rule coincided with economic collapse, rising unemployment, and round after round of austerity, as the government sought to get ahead of the debt crisis. The new government's large majority will give it more room to manage an unmanageable crisis. Spanish yields are rising today, along with those of Italy. The crisis is beyond the power of individual governments to solve on their own; coordination is key.Which makes one piece of news out of Brussels today seem at least somewhat auspicious. The European Commission has put together a white paper, to be released this week, proposing the creation of euro bonds. It appears that three different options are discussed, moving along the spectrum of shared risk. In those least ambitious version, the combined governments of the euro zone would provide some guarantee for the newly issued bonds of national governments. In the most ambitious scheme, the euro zone would approve individual budgets, which would be financed through euro bonds.

Needless to say, we were surprised given that a) we had no relationship with B of A, b) we had made a point to always pay more than was due on our mortgage each month, c) nobody with the name of the person they were trying to collect from had ever owned the home (I've seen the property records going back to when the house was built) and d) as surreal and the whole thing was, we had to hire an attorney to make the whole mess go away.  In part because of that experience, some time after that my wife and I closed out all of our B of A accounts.  Or so I thought.  In the process of closing out my account, our account balance by definition became zero.  This is important because when one's balance is below $2,500, one is charged a monthly service fee.  Apparently, we have been assessing monthly service fees since the point where we thought we closed our accounts.  It seems that now we are carrying a negative balance that happens to equal a multiple of the service fee on an account that I closed a while ago.      Now, the Supreme Court has stated that corporations are essentially similar to a person.  But imagine if a person did something like this.  Imagine what would happen to me, for instance, if I filed papers to foreclose on a branch of B of A using, as an excuse, the fact that someone that B of A had no relationship with owed me money.  And what would happen if I followed that up some time later by sending B of A a bill for services they not only had not requested, but had been most vehement that they didn't want.  In addition to being charged with fraud, I imagine at this point it would also be considered harassment.    In general, a human being behaving this way would face consequences.  Even a human being well-connected enough not to have to worry about being arrested by the cops or prosecuted by the DA still has to worry about whether the next time his intended victim would be waiting with a shotgun.  B of A, on the other hand, truly has no constraints on its behavior.  No matter how unprofitable its behavior, it has been deemed too big to fail.  And society, having made the decision to privilege some sociopaths, also implicitly made the decision that everyone else qualifies as prey.      \r\n")

You doubt my story ni\xc3\xb1os? You are brave.       For our readers that have not been following this story, we brought you  this news  in July which television streaming website  TVCatchup   considered themselves to be victorious in a long running legal battle with UK broadcasters ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.    It was the broadcasters claim that TVCatchup were using material that they did not own the rights to. The response from TVCatchup was that they were only making temporary copies (then relaying free to air TV channels to users via computers and smartphones) of this material and that was a lawful use. In a recent ruling in the High Court, Mr Justice Floyd affirmed his earlier provisional ruling that the reproduction by the the creation of \xe2\x80\x9crolling copies\xe2\x80\x9d of broadcasts in TVCatchups \xe2\x80\x9cmemory buffers\xe2\x80\x9d and then on its members screens did not amount to a reproduction or copy of the broadcasts and TVCatchup.    It might seem quite strange but UK copyright laws do not make \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary copies\xe2\x80\x9d unlawful if the are \xe2\x80\x9ctransient or incidental\xe2\x80\x9d to the whole works and are made in order to ensure the programme is technically broadcast with \xe2\x80\x9cno\xc2\xa0independent\xc2\xa0significance\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0Mr Justice Floyd based his provisional ruling in July on the fact that the section of stored video was approximately 30 to 40 seconds long.    The only outstanding question in which Mr Justice Floyd thought required further clarification from the European Courts of Justice was in relation to whether there has been a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication to the public\xe2\x80\x9d which is in contravention to UK copyright laws. It is likely to be some time before this is all dealt with.     Got any issues that you would like Len Dastard to consider? Get in touch \xe2\x80\x93 hello@bitterwallet.com        \r\n')

From the report      Procurement funding grew from $62.6B in FY01 to as much as $135.8B throughout the decade.3 In constant dollars, base procurement funding in FY10 increased by 41 percent from FY01.4 Increases also were augmented by the use of supplemental war funding. In FY02, only $1.4B was appropriated for procurement in supplemental war funding. That increased every year until $65.9B was appropriated in FY08. FY08 ended up as the high water mark, but the following three years have all seen procurement funding of about $30B included in war funding.5 In all, $232.8B or 22 percent of total procurement funding in the last decade came from supplemental war funding. Although procurement funding increased in the base budget, supplemental war funding significantly enhanced the resources available.       The Mother Jones article   says the military is hardly in dire straits when it comes to funding its big-ticket items. "The services capitalized on funding to modernize their forces, especially the major weapons programs that constitute the heart of the services\' capabilities," writes the report\'s author, Russell Rumbaugh\xe2\x80\x94a retired Army officer and ex-CIA military analyst.    The study shows there\'s one big reason the brass are concerned about budget-cutting discussions in Congress: They\'ve been double dipping into the taxpayer\'s pocket to finance weapons purchases. Of the roughly $1 trillion spent on gadgetry since 9/11, 22 percent of it came from "supplemental" war funding\xe2\x80\x94annual outlays that are voted on separately from the regular defense budget. Those bills are primarily intended to keep day-to-day operations running in Iraq and Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x94meaning that if a member of Congress votes against a supplemental spending bill, she exposes herself to charges that she doesn\'t "support the troops" in harm\'s way.    And there\'s plenty to cut, thanks to McKeon and his congressional cohort. This spring, they  preserved defense earmarks  after vowing that they wouldn\'t; voted to  make more Humvees the Army doesn\'t want  (and reject Afghanistan base defense systems that it did); to keep  an unnecessary $3 billion GE contract  to build an "alternative engine" for the single-engine Joint Strike Fighter, whose costs are approaching $1 trillion; and  to repatriate US victims  of the 1804 Barbary War in Libya.    In their defense, they did vote to trim defense dollars by  banning color copies  at the Pentagon.          \r\n')

What better time for Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne to announce that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Green Deal initiative will be loading a massive \xc2\xa3280 on to the average bill by 2020.    At present, the average household pays \xc2\xa389 a year on their bills to support the government\xe2\x80\x99s green energy campaign, but this amount is set to rise every year until it hits \xc2\xa3280 in 2020. The money will be used to provide around \xc2\xa38 billion a year towards the \xc2\xa3200 billion cost of new wind farms, nuclear power stations, a new pylon network and fitting more solar panels. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news. The Government defended the rises saying they will be counteracted by other government policies to help people reduce the amount of energy they use. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has confirmed the cost of the various Governmental Green Deal policies in this handy diagram.         The diagram shows that average householders who undertake all of the changes to behaviour assumed, including installing smart meters and loft insulation, will actually save money on their energy bills, and these savings, by 2020, will amount to \xc2\xa3373. Note that this is not a discount from energy bills, but is a hypothetical saving on energy costs. That the Government can then add their \xe2\x80\x98green tax\xe2\x80\x99 to so that bills are up to \xc2\xa394 a year cheaper.    Chris Huhne said, yesterday \xe2\x80\x9cWe will secure our energy at the lowest cost: in the short term by promoting competition; in the medium term by insulating our homes and in the long term by steering us away from excessive reliance on fossil fuels and on to clean, green and secure energy.\xe2\x80\x9d    However, with people already struggling with rising energy bills most households are unlikely to be happy about paying more today in order to prevent possible rises in the future. And what about people who are unable to adopt all the green measures? Homeowners without attics to insulate or cavity walls will definitely see increased bills owing to Government levies.    Thomas Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch.com said \xe2\x80\x9cThe big question is over whether the costs are more certain than the benefits, as the success of many of these policies will rely on consumers changing their behaviour or taking up the new options that will be made available to them \xe2\x80\xa6 The fact is that the UK is on the brink of an affordability crisis when it comes to household energy and it will be difficult for consumers if they have to carry the cost of these policies before seeing the benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d    The energy secretary also announced 14 million homes could be fitted with insulation and other energy-saving measures, and householders will be able to take out loans of up to \xc2\xa310,000 over a 25-year term.    However, our consumer friends Which! ares warning consumers that this not an energy efficiency grant- the money comes in the form of a loan and anyone taking up the Green Deal will be expected to pay interest.    \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see how hard-pressed homeowners will have confidence in how the Green Deal might work for them if the suggested savings are initially based on averages rather than on their personal energy use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which!     Simplification?     While it is unlikely Governmental levies will be separately disclosed on energy bills, at least one Energy company is trying to simplify matters. British Gas announced today that all of its tariffs will be scrapped to be replaced with just two options \xe2\x80\x93 fixed and variable. Changes will be implemented today for new customers and variable customers but existing fixed customers will run to the end of their current term, and then move onto the new tariff.    British Gas MD Phil Bentley admitted that some bills would go up, as in the past British Gas had offered cheap deals that were unsustainable and were loss making for the company, who made a profit of \xc2\xa3270m in 2011. British Gas increased gas prices by 18pc and electricity prices by 16pc over the summer, costing customers an extra \xc2\xa3200 a year.    Mr Bentley said that the company had been forced to charge \xe2\x80\x9chonest customers\xe2\x80\x9d more to fund the cheaper offers. So now everyone pays the higher price. Good job BG.       \r\n')

This year, 44 percent of shoppers say getting a good deal is more important than it was last year, and a third say they will be spending less than they did last year.       &#8220;As we approach the 2011 winter holidays - the fourth straight season set against a backdrop of economic uncertainly - Americans remain fixated on finances: their own and that of the nation,&#8221; said Tod Marks, Consumer Reports senior editor and resident shopping expert. &#8220;So it&#8217;s not surprising that people are even more intent on watching their dollars, shopping on a set budget and, of course, bargain-hunting.&#8221;        Tips to help you stay on budget this holiday season:        1. Pay with cash    Shoppers who use credit cards spend more on holiday gifts than those who don't, we've found time and again in our shopper surveys. Stores don't have to pay a transaction fee for cash purchases, as they do with debit and credit cards, so you might be able to get a discount if you pay with cash, particularly on big-ticket items. Lord & Taylor still accepts personal checks in its branches, and if layaway appeals to you, Kmart, Sears, and Walmart have programs.        2. Use plastic with care    Try to resist the temptation to charge more than you can afford or you'll be nursing a debt hangover long after the holidays are over. Only take the bait for a store credit card and its one-time extra savings if you're buying something expensive and know you can pay the balance on time and in full. Store credit cards typically carry interest rates of 20 percent or higher. To avoid lowering your credit score, don't apply for more than one store card in a season.       3. Nix the warranty    Our years of surveying consumers have confirmed that extended warranties for most electronics and household appliances aren't worth the money. Those items usually don't break during their warranty period, and if they do, the average cost of repair isn't much more than the cost of an average warranty. And extended warranties often have loopholes, such as not covering problems caused by wear and tear. However, a plan that covers theft or accidental damage might be worth considering for a laptop, netbook, or tablet you'll use on the go. Also know that some credit-card providers&#8212;notably American Express&#8212;offer extended warranty protection on products purchased with the card.        4. Ship for free    Online shoppers can stay on budget by taking advantage of free shipping offers, many of which are listed at  FreeShipping.org . The site also sponsors Free Shipping Day, Dec. 16, one of the last opportunities for online shoppers to get free shipping from popular retailers for delivery by Dec. 24. Merchants who have signed on include the Apple Online Store, Bed Bath & Beyond, Cabela's, eBags, Kohl's, Lands' End, REI, Zales, and Ghirardelli and Godiva chocolatiers.       5. Haggle    We've said it before, not enough people try their hand at haggling. In one of our recent surveys, shoppers who said they haggled at walk-in stores saved an average of $82. You can also haggle online. Nearly three of five survey respondents were successful in scoring a price break. A third of them negotiated with a retailer by phone vs. 29 percent through e-mails, and 13 percent by online chat.

One reason, aside from the convenience of seeing a doctor in the same building you buy your groceries, is that, per the Rand study, these retail clinics cost consumers 30-40% less than going to a doctor\'s office, and 80% less expensive than going to the emergency room, which some people who lack health insurance go because they know it is unlikely they will be turned away.

But more complicated organs elude them. Nor has anyone managed to grow bone marrow.  At first sight, that is surprising. The soft and squishy marrow inside bones does not look like a highly structured tissue, but apparently it is. This does not matter for transplants: if marrow cells are moved from one bone to another they quickly make themselves at home. But it matters for research. Bone marrow plays an important role in the immune system and in bodily rejuvenation. Stem cells that originate within the marrow generate ...   \r\n')

Last week our minivan\xe2\x80\x99s transmission bit the dust.\xc2\xa0 (Thankfully it bit the dust in our driveway.)\xc2\xa0 Over the next couple of days my wife and I discussed what to do: whether to fix our car, whether to buy a new-to-us one \xe2\x80\x94 buying a new car didn\xe2\x80\x99t enter the picture! \xe2\x80\x94 which kind to buy, and how to pay for it.    We had a very level-headed discussion about the whole matter.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that  we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a thing or two  now that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching our tenth anniversary.\xc2\xa0 At some points in the discussion, when it was getting serious and when we were trying to make sure that we understood each other, our daughter came in to ask this or that, and at first we asked her to let us finish the discussion privately.    After we got through that part of the conversation, we called her in to let her know that nothing was wrong and that we needed to think carefully about what to do because it was a lot of money.    At some point, either my wife or I made the observation that this topic really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over her head, or something that we needed to shield her from.\xc2\xa0 We really didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to discuss the financial questions of getting a car privately.     So after that point, we involved our daughter in buying the car. \xc2\xa0 My wife took her to CarMax and she got to ride in the cars, and tell her which one she liked better and why.\xc2\xa0 But probably the more important part was that she learned that we were going to borrow money to get the car.\xc2\xa0 We explained that we were going to ask our credit union to lend us money to buy the car, and that we had to pay it back or else they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to take the car, because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really own the car until the loan was paid back.    Then tonight my daughter asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy, why are you getting a loan for the car?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Music to my ears \xe2\x80\x94 not necessarily  because  we\xe2\x80\x99re borrowing, but because this is the most advanced money question my daughter has asked about to date.\xc2\xa0 I got to explain some things about investments to her.\xc2\xa0 I explained that we could sell some of our investments to pay for the car, but at this time we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xc2\xa0 I got to explain the concept of interest to her, and that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t free to borrow money.\xc2\xa0 I also got to explain the concept of creditworthiness to her; because Mommy and Daddy pay their bills on time, the bank didn\xe2\x80\x99t charge us much interest on the loan.\xc2\xa0 (We got approved for a  very  good rate on our used car loan.)    It was great to see her asking questions about personal finance.\xc2\xa0  I think the trick was not to hide the family\xe2\x80\x99s personal finance from her.

But a new study of current data and analysis by Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature offers strong support to the existing temperature compilations. The results, described in four papers still undergoing peer review, are released on October 20th. It estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911\xc2\xb0C: a mere 2% less than NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s estimate.

By understanding which genetic changes have been consolidated in the Belgian blue, it may be possible to design and build similar versions of other species using genetic engineering as a short-cut. And that is precisely what Terry Bradley, a fish biologist at the University of Rhode Island, is trying to do. Instead of cattle, he is doing it in trout. His is one of two projects that may soon put the first biotech animals on the dinner table.  Belgian blues are so big because their genes for a protein called myostatin do not work properly. Myostatin is a hormone that regulates muscle growth. Disable its action and muscles will grow in parts of the anatomy where other animals do not even have them.   Dr Bradley has launched ...   \r\n')

To help pay for their defence, China\xe2\x80\x99s provincial governments borrowed money from foreign investors. As collateral, they offered claims on Shanghai\xe2\x80\x99s customs revenues.

Besides saving Shanghai from a divine  sibling, it is also a rational way to finance long-lived infrastructure, spreading costs over the same period as the benefits.

That changed on November 15th when Shanghai sold the first bonds under a new scheme, raising 7.1 billion yuan ($1.1 billion).In allowing the sale the central government is quietly acknowledging that the 1994 ban has become counterproductive.

No prizes for guessing which large Asian nation the senators have in mind.  Variants of this bill have been introduced regularly since 2003; all have failed. But this time may be different: anti-China sentiment in both parties has grown. Republican leaders have so far resisted holding a vote on a similar bill in the House of Representatives and look unlikely to change their minds; but if they do, the bill would almost certainly pass.

Given the complexity of the balance of payments, there are too many angles to tackle in one post. Therefore, spanning the next week I will dedicate my commentary to the EA balance of payments. In this post, we start with square one: the current account.           The Euro area (EA) current account     Often times I hear comparison of the EA sovereign debt crisis to past emerging market balance of payments crises. This is not correct, since the EA runs only mild current account deficits, -0.9% of total EA GDP as of Q2 2011 (Q3 data reported in December). There\xe2\x80\x99s no need for a sharp revaluation of the euro to drive the balance of payments to its identity \xe2\x80\x93 remember, the current account (CA) + capital account (KA) + official reserves + errors/ommissions = 0.                   The standard emerging market-style balance of payments crisis goes something like this: large current account deficits must be financed by foreign inflows of capital (financial account surpluses), so that the currency comes under pressure when foreigners lose confidence in said emerging market economy. As foreign capital flows start to reverse, the currency comes under pressure to balance the financial and current accounts. Under currency depreciation, relative costs rise (via imported goods), so the central bank \xe2\x80\x98defends\xe2\x80\x99 the level of the currency through FX intervention (they sell down FX reserves and buy the domestic currency). With the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s stock of FX reserves depleting quickly, speculators can sell the domestic currency for much longer than the national central bank can buy up those assets. Eventually, the whole thing comes crashing down. The currency depreciates (quite materially in some cases) and brings the current account into balance.           The EA initial condition for a balance of payments crisis is just not there: the current account is, well, rather \xe2\x80\x98balanced\xe2\x80\x99.  Within the EA, country-level current accounts are well out of balance. This is the central theme associated with the EA sovereign debt crisis: debtor countries are reliant on foreign inflows of capital from the credit countries to support current spending.         The chart above illustrates the 4-quarter moving average current account deficit (red)/surplus (green) as a % of national GDP ending in Q2 2011.    In the context of the standard balance of payments crisis, Greece and Portugal would/should have seen precipitous nominal FX depreciation by now. In contrast, the Netherlands or Germany would have seen significant appreciation. However, the single currency union prevents nominal depreciation, so the focus has been on  real  depreciation. The debtor countries are forced into a policy of internal devaluation (fiscal austerity, they call it) to shift relative prices and real exchange rates. This could work if global growth was going gangbusters, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not.    These imbalances are no longer sustainable.    I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with a link as to the direction we\xe2\x80\x99ll be headed here on The Wilder View. Last month Thomas Mayer released a report titled  Euroland\xe2\x80\x99s hidden balance-of-payments crisis , which describes imbalances building in the EA financial flows. Next post we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into the balance of payments flows within the EA.         originally published at  The Wilder View...Economonitors        \r\n')

Hungary\'s  economic difficulties are serious (the combination of large foreign-currency debts and a weakening forint is especially alarming). It is more vulnerable to the chaos in the euro zone than any of the nearby countries. But to be fair, Hungary is no longer in the intensive-care ward as it was when the IMF bailed it out in 2008. Mr Orb\xc3\xa1n inherited a mess and has (thanks to some bruising, and in some cases questionable, measures) brought public finances under control.Similarly it is easy to exaggerate criticism of Mr Orb\xc3\xa1n\'s political approach. His headstrong way with public institutions can seem like a power grab, until you remember that Hungary\'s political system is based on the idea of "winner takes all". The Fidesz party that he leads gained a hefty mandate in the 2010 elections and has since then, quite rightly in his supporters\' eyes, carrying out his mandate of stabilisation and reform.

that appear on my hotel bills are creeping steadily upward. I\xe2\x80\x99m apparently not alone with this observation. According to a new study by Dr. Bjorn Hanson from the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, hotel fees and surcharges will account for $1.8 billion revenue in 2011, up from $1.7 billion in 2010. The increase comes from higher fees as well as more travelers (or escapists) spending time in hotels.    This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account the various taxes that appear on hotel bills. On a recent trip to California, my itemized hotel bill includes an Occupancy Sales Tax (12 percent) and a Convention and Tourism Tax (0.02 percent). In addition to the taxes, if I had done anything in the hotel other than sleep, I might have seen my bill peppered with fees such as telephone calls, internet fees, early check-in fees, late departure fees, business center fees, and if the hotel had been a little nicer, a resort fee.     Here are a few suggestions for avoiding hotel fees and saving money while traveling.     1. Know your fees before you travel.  Unfortunately, many hotels make it difficult to have full knowledge of fees during comparison shopping. If you book your hotel room by using a website that compares rates at a variety of hotel brands, you\xe2\x80\x99re only seeing the full story. Airlines have found this to be an advantage, and hotels are following suit. The least expensive hotel when comparing nightly rates may enforce additional surcharges.    One solution is to look at the individual hotels\xe2\x80\x99 websites, but not every hotel is gracious enough to list all the fees that they may charge. You might have better luck calling the hotel directly and asking for the details.     2. Negotiate your rates.  When I\xe2\x80\x99ve put in an effort, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success reducing the overall nightly rates and negotiating removal of some fees, particularly internet access fees. You may not have much room for negotiation if you book your travel using a third-party website or even the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s own online booking system, but taking the small step of calling the hotel \xe2\x80\x94 and you just called to ask about fees, anyway \xe2\x80\x94 and asking for the best rates and fee considerations can work well. If you can pit one hotel\xe2\x80\x99s offer against a local, comparable hotel\xe2\x80\x99s offer, you could have even more success.     3. Bring your own internet service.  If your business involves the internet, as mine does, you may find you need to be connected more often than not. Earlier this year, I decided to bring the internet with me by getting a mobile WiFi hotspot from my wireless provider, Verizon Wireless. It has helped me in a number of situations where I needed to have internet access while I was away from home. The service can be worthwhile for anyone who travels while needing to be online.     Mobile WiFi may be more expensive than a few nights each month with hotel-provided internet access, but if you need to be online on the road, the service is better than hotel room internet.     4. Avoid resort hotels.  You would think that more expensive hotels would include more services. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen charges at fancier hotels for services that less expensive hotels offer for free. In a resort hotel, you may find it hard to resist the temptation to take advantage of some of the more unique services, like spa access.      5. Don\xe2\x80\x99t call room service.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning for a longer stay, look for kitchen availability in the room and prepare your own meals. With a local grocery store, you could avoid dining out as well as relying on the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s own expensive kitchen.     6. Stay with friends or family rather than the hotel.  If you know your stay won\xe2\x80\x99t be a burden, and you need to travel while spending as little money as possible, you might be successful crashing on a couch as a guest.      7. Couchsurf.  Couchsurfing is one of the newest travel trends. Like the above tip, the comfort of a home often beats a hotel, and you never have to worry about hidden fees. With couchsurfing, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to trust a stranger as a host, but you can review a potential host\xe2\x80\x99s references on  couchsurfing.com .     8. Carry your own baggage.  If you are staying in a hotel, one of the great conveniences is the presence of porters who help move your bags from the lobby to your room, for a nomial fee encouraged by an outstretched palm. In most cases, this service is unnecessary. This is one of the smaller fees you may be expected to pay, but if your goal is to take the most frugal approach, it\xe2\x80\x99s easily avoidable.     9. Park elsewhere.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re staying at a hotel where space is at a premium, within a city for example, you may be subjecting yourself to a fee for parking. If you must bring a car, you might be able to find a parking lot nearby for less money.      10. Leave yourself enough time to review your bill.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re rushing to check out quickly in order to catch a flight or your next appointment, you might not give your hotel bill the attention it deserves. Some hotels are kind enough to slip your bill under your door early on your check-out date, but if not, leave enough time to review your bill line by line. If there is a charge you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with, have it removed by talking to the manager. This happened to me on one of the first hotel stays I experienced as an adult responsible for paying the bill \xe2\x80\x94 and at a time when I probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money for taking vacations, anyway.

The point was that any increase in productivity required a corresponding increase in the number of consumers capable of buying the product. The original Henry Ford, committed to raising productivity and lowering prices remorselessly, appreciated this profoundly\xe2\x80\x94and insisted on paying his workers twice the going rate, so they could afford to buy his cars.For the company, there was an added bonus. By offering an unprecedented $5 a day in 1914, he caused the best tool-makers and machinists in America to flock to Ford. The know-how they brought boosted production efficiency still further and made Ford cars ever more affordable. With its ingenious Model T, Ford became the first car company in the world to bring motoring to the masses.Economists see this as a classic example of how advancing technology, in the form of automation and innovation, increases productivity.

As prime minister of a Conservative government with majorities in both houses of Parliament, he seems to have changed his mind. The Fair Representation bill, which the government introduced last month and is pushing to get through Parliament before Christmas, will add 30 MPs to the tally of 308.The western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, where the population is rising fast, will each get six extra seats. But Ontario will get another 15 and Quebec three. Tim Uppal, the junior minister piloting the measure, said that it will move Canada closer to the elusive goal of representation by population, last met a century ago. Just redistributing the existing number of seats to reflect the westward population shift, as the opposition Liberals propose, cannot be done because it would create winners and losers, Mr Uppal candidly conceded.Mr Harper\xe2\x80\x99s is hardly the first federal government that for the sake of peace with the provinces wants only winners to emerge from the redistricting, which takes place every ten years following a national census.

I never quite fit in with big hierarchical systems, like public education (as a teacher) and corporations. Getting things done, particularly accomplishing various things the way I wanted to accomplish them, has always been a struggle for me in these structures. I knew from the day I started working at a corporation after leaving a small non-profit arts agency that I would never quite  find my bliss  or even thrive in that type of environment. I remember thinking that my first job, an administrative type of position, didn\xe2\x80\x99t add any value to the world. The position only existed from a pure corporate need, not a societal need. If the corporation weren\xe2\x80\x99t as big as it was, my job function would be unnecessary.    There were other options for me to consider such as owning an independent school of some type or creating an arts foundation, but those goals required two things I did not have at the time: money and experience. So I stuck it out in the corporation for more years than I would have liked, and I put energy into hobbies like writing and blogging.    My hobby became a business over time, and you can see this in its incarnation as  Consumerism Commentary . While all I was doing initially was learning how to become the  chief financial officer of my own life , I became the CEO of a company that was helping me attain that first goal. Being a CEO has been outside of my comfort zone, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a number of mistakes over the last few years. The experience has been one of growth for me, and I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually get the hang of running a business and accepting the fact that I am an entrepreneur.    In the past, the word \xe2\x80\x9centrepreneur\xe2\x80\x9d has always been associated with a negative connotation for me. I viewed people who called themselves entrepreneurs as people who knew exactly what to say to manipulate others into relationships. They\xe2\x80\x99re savvy, smooth, and disingenuous; they see all communication and relationship-building with a purpose in mind \xe2\x80\x94 building their own business and growing wealth for themselves.    Now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve become what other people often call an entrepreneur, I\xe2\x80\x99m dealing with this cognitive dissonance. What other choice did I have, though, to work for myself? I was out-of-place in formally-structured work environments, particularly where I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t free to take whatever approach to my work I wanted, when I wanted. I may have misjudged entrepreneurship, but I still see this type of posturing in my daily experiences operating Consumerism Commentary.    To add another layer to the idea of entrepreneurship, with the employment market still very much in favor of employers, the trend in financial advisory media towards working for oneself has increased in volume \xe2\x80\x94 in both senses, quantity and amplitude. I do agree that by finding a way to work for yourself removes employers from the picture, giving you much more control over your financial destiny. (A portion of that control just moves from an employer to potential clients or customers, however.) A typical advice-based article attempts to convince all corporate drones to leave their unfulfilling job and start their own businesses.     Taken to the extreme, a nation of business owners wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. This advice, however, might inspire a small portion of readers to crash through their psychological barriers and find a way to add value directly. Not everyone will be a successful entrepreneur.     I think there are certain personality traits that lend themselves to being a great business owner, first from a Myers-Briggs perspective, where the best business owners likely have a profile of \xe2\x80\x9cENTJ.\xe2\x80\x9d (After some quick research, I\xe2\x80\x99m right on the money with this assessment; the ENTJ type is often called  The Executive  type.) For contrast, I am an \xe2\x80\x9cINFP.\xe2\x80\x9d        Extraversion.  Dealing with business issues is much easier for someone on the Extraversion side of the first dimension. This would be someone who feels energized after dealing with people. I find certain aspects of dealing with people on a business level very draining, though I am comfortable being among large groups of people. I am slightly on the Introversion side of this dimension, but a Myers-Briggs Step II assessment reveals that this is slightly different from my core personality, which would call for a stronger Introversion score.     Judging.  While my personality traits register on the Feeling side of this dimension, a Judging tendency helps people lend themselves towards the same working structures I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been comfortable with. The same trait that encourages the hierarchical approach to business, helpful when working in school systems and large corporations, is also beneficial to running a business. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been uncomfortable judging the sincerity of people I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with in the past. Many of my mistakes I alluded to above are related to my impressions of people.     Self-motivation.  Without a boss providing guidance and deadlines, the responsibility for performing rests only with the business owner. I find that motivation is much easier when you own the process. Like students who perform better in college when they pay their own tuition, an entrepreneur\xe2\x80\x99s business is all about that one person. The ability to design a business based around something you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about or particularly skilled at will infuse motivation into many people who\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled with this in other employment settings.     Forward-looking and big picture.  Anyone who is content with repetitive tasks or would prefer to perform a job by following a step-by-step guide may not be best suited for a life of entrepreneurialism. Running your own business requires looking beyond the next step. It involves always considering the big picture and the ability to define goals. Not everyone is suited for this level of thinking.     Determination.  From the outside, determination can look like stupidity. Being determined in the face of critics, refusing to give up regardless of what someone else might think of your abilities or your business\xe2\x80\x99s potential is essential to becoming successful. Not only that, but considering businesses often fail, being serious about working for yourself requires the ability to brush off the failures and use them as an opportunity to learn about the business and about yourself.        A careless attitude towards money.  Many entrepreneurs have succeeded because they have had the financial means to go after their dreams. If you\xe2\x80\x99re already wealthy, you can stand to take some risks with your business. Someone less established financially would find it much more difficult to justify the risks. For a business like mine, there was not much financial risk at the beginning. I did, however, spend almost all of my waking and some of my sleeping hours to finding a path to success, to the dismay of those who sought to spend more time with me.    The concentration on my own business most likely affected, though probably in a small way, my ability to focus on and care about my day job. I may have missed out on promotions because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going beyond my job scope, I was using my own time to build a business. In the end, it was the right decision for me, but it could have easily gone another way. I would have ended up with a continued low salary and no income on the side. From a truly financial perspective, starting a business can be a careless risk. Good entrepreneurs accept this or ignore this, or are just unaware of this.           Obsessive-compulsive.  With the biography of Steven Jobs due out soon, a lot of media attention has surrounded his attitude, particularly his obsessiveness. In the book, Jobs is described as not settling for anything less than perfection all the time, and perfection in his opinion could rarely be defined before him. He would know it when he were to see it.    From a design perspective, this has shown to be immensely perspective. As Malcolm Gladwell  said in his coverage of the biography , \xe2\x80\x9cThe great accomplishment of Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s life is how effectively he put his idiosyncrasies\xe2\x80\x94his petulance, his narcissism, and his rudeness\xe2\x80\x94in the service of perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d           Generalist.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s economy seems to appreciate specialists over generalists, but I see the opposite as being the better approach to a fulfilling life \xe2\x80\x94 and generalism is an approach particularly suited for entrepreneurship. Large companies have the need for specialists, people who are very good, excellent, or best in the world at doing one particular thing. This can be a very narrow skill. An entrepreneur who starts a company from the ground up, particularly with limited resources at the beginning, needs to be able to handle many different types of tasks and goals, at the same time, while holding herself to a very high standard.    As the business grows, there can be adjustments. When struggling and to build their business, the founders of Yahoo brought in a CEO from the outside because running the company at a certain level required skills the founders couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite meet on their own. During the start-up phase, however, the entrepreneurs needed to find a way to tackle all the hard tasks. In this respect, being a jack of all trades, master of none is the best approach for an entrepreneur, provided that this particular jack is a very skilled jack in all trades.          Leaving traditional employment structures behind is not for everyone, and the advice we often see telling everyone to quit their job and start a business can be largely ignored. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t predisposed towards at least a few of these personality traits, success will be very difficult. If, however, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have these traits in your system, you can train yourself to be comfortable with the actions you would be taking if these traits were embedded in your personality. Acting against your personal profile can be very stressful, though, and might lead to an unsatisfying conclusion.     What do you think about being an entrepreneur? Is it something anybody can do with a little practice or are there certain personality traits necessary for success? Would you consider starting your own business if you felt it was a better path to greater financial well-being over time?

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that thanks to customer backlash and likely due to a public relations nightmare, the bank is reversing its policy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a smart move, but is it too late? Bank of America has done a great job burning an imagine in customers\xe2\x80\x99 minds of a bank that is willing to sacrifice its customers \xe2\x80\x94 not to recover from a potential loss, but to recover from a lower profit due to regulators\xe2\x80\x99 new rules against excessive interchange fees. Corporations are expected to look for profit under every rock, but this particular type of fee hurts low-income customers much more than high-income customers. You would have been able to avoid the potential fee by having a significant balance of deposits held at the bank, much more than the typical customer might hold.    On Twitter,  Michael Kitces  from  kitces.com  said in response to my comment about the fee cancellation, \xe2\x80\x9cI think people that BoA didn\xe2\x80\x99t want as customers still got the message loud & clear, even if BoA drops the fee now.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyle  from  Amateur Asset Allocator  responded, \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect my attitude one way or another. If I were affected, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably just go to cash-only instead of using the debit card.\xe2\x80\x9d    This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect plans for  Bank Transfer Day . This fee could have been the wake-up call consumers needed to gain the extra motivation to move to a credit union. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with the interchange fee regulation, a window of potential profit closed in one area leads to another window opening somewhere else. Bank of America and the other banks who dropped plans for a debit card fee will find a way to earn their profits, and the next fee may not be nearly as transparent and well-marketed as the debit card fee.    Keep an eye on those bank statements.

Microraptor  (see photograph) is one of many small, feathered dinosaurs found in what is now China that were alive during the Cretaceous period more than 66m years ago. Being feathered, it and its kind were cousins to birds. The actual split between the two groups, though, had happened much earlier, during the Jurassic period (the first known bird is  Archaeopteryx , from 150m years ago), and by the late Cretaceous there were many species of bird around. What Dr O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and her colleagues have found is the remains of one of those birds, of an as-yet-unidentified species, in the stomach...    \r\n')

Andreas Gurksy,  Rhein II,  was sold at auction for $4,338,500 to an anonymous buyer. The record-breaking sale allowed Gursky to reclaim fame as the artist whose work has claimed the highest price paid for a photograph. This auction was a secondary market sale. As in most art auctions commanding high prices and press attention, the artist sees little if any financial benefit.    What do you think of the image? Is it art? Is it art you would consider to be worth $4 million? $1 million?         It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this lowly jpeg that was sold. Seeing the print \xe2\x80\x94 considered a very important part of the art of photography \xe2\x80\x94 is an experience in itself. To see this work in person, you would be gazing at a print eight feet by twelve feet. Even today\xe2\x80\x99s relatively advanced digital cameras, devices used by professional wedding photographers and amateurs like me around the world, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to produce a print that size with quality and resolution. This image was most likely produced with a large format camera using analog film.     There\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to determine the value of a work of art: offer it to a wide audience of potential art buys and determine what at least one of them would be willing to pay to take it home. Looking beyond the simple supply-and-demand answer, any piece of art is able to fetch a certain price at auction due to only a few factors. Some aspects moving a price aren\xe2\x80\x99t related to the specific piece of art as much as the artist.        Buyers look for a works by photographers who have a history of creating art in demand by galleries and collectors.    Photographers who were trained by other artists who have been successful are also rewarded for their potential.    In most cases, buyers believe that the art will be worth more in the future, and view the purchase as an investment.       Some reasons behind a price relate to the process of creating the art. It\xe2\x80\x99s only recently that photography has become accepted as art, color photography even more recently, and many artists still consider photographs with digital manipulation in editing software like Photoshop not art at all. Photography still has a long way to go before it\xe2\x80\x99s fully accepted alongside oil painting and sculpture as art. That\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in value as well; while this $4 million price for  Rhein II  is a nice sum, it falls short of the  Running Man I  sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, which  fetched a sale price of $104.3 million  recently.     The fact that this image was captured using a large format camera, a process that is significantly more involved than pointing and shooting, helps to add to the value, but many photographers, particularly landscape artists and architectural photographers, still use large format cameras. The type of camera cannot be the sole reason driving the value of art, but it is an important factor when an artist is striving for the best quality possible.     Although this image looks simple, a lot of planning went into its creation. Artists carefully plan the time and place, bring the right equipment, and without a digital camera, do not have the luxury of taking a flurry of snapshots to choose the best image of one hundred on a memory card. Often, a work of art is part of a series or a study on a particular theme, and in the case of  Rhein II,  the photograph falls within a series about the river in Germany.    Ken Rockwell, a respected but divisive photographer who has one of the most popular websites about the art, has this to say about the photograph.     It is valuable because it is art, not just a photo. Rules are worthless. If [Gurksy] was just a photographer instead of an artist, he would have been crippled by the nonexistent \xe2\x80\x9crule of thirds\xe2\x80\x9d myth, and put the horizon someplace else. In his case, the horizon slams right through the middle, which adds to the power by giving a sense of unease. Our minds ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s up with this? This is so barren and empty; where is this place?\xe2\x80\x9d    Likewise, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not captured on film, it is not art. Artists create art, not photographers. Artists may choose to work in photography, but being an artist is what matters above all\xe2\x80\xa6    If shot with a digital Nikon or Canon like amateur photographers, it would not have been art. If he used a zoom lens or many modern prime lenses, their distortion would have subtly curved the lines, weakening and destroying the artist\xe2\x80\x99s work.       Ken doesn\xe2\x80\x99t point out that Gursky did digitally manipulate the image after making the capture. The view portrayed by the image above doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in nature. Gursky removed people, dogs, and a building from the captured image to create the art.    Nevertheless, the image is so simple that it looks like something anyone can capture, standing beside any river in the world on any dreary day. One nature of art is the ability to stir emotions in a spectator, even if that emotion is anger in response to a sale price, frustration that an image of mostly straight lines and solid colors can be considered art, jealousy that another photographer\xe2\x80\x99s images wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fetch such a price, confusion about why it\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable for some digitally manipulated images to be considered art while others aren\xe2\x80\x99t, or questioning whether the image is art at all.    This describes the industry reaction to the sale. The Luminous Landscape forums are  buzzing with comments  about this sale and the image from professional photographers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly commercial photographers who dabble with artistic photography, specializing in medium and large format cameras.     Why spend so much money on art?    With so many problems in the world, why spend $4 million on one piece of art rather than using that money to build a school or feed starving children? This is a fair question to ask. At this high level of sophisticated art acquisition, there is a big emphasis on the investment aspect of art. With the photographer still living and with photographic art still being rare compared to other visual art methods, there is a good possibility of the value of this work increasing over the very long term.     Although it\xe2\x80\x99s common to question the intent of purchasing a work of art for $4 million, investors who dedicate the same amount of money to a company to become an owner of that company usually won\xe2\x80\x99t face the same questions about the virtue of their investment. Both buying art and buying a company are capitalistic endeavors, but while the value of a company can be easily justified by looking at a set of financial reports, the art is more difficult to rationalize. Regardless of the reasons, the value of a company or a work of art is whatever someone is willing to pay.    By investing in art, it sends a signal that art, in general, is worth society\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Art is an important part of civilized society, and both reacts to and inspires thought that drives a society forward.

The goal: inject a hearty dose of transparency into the global ETF universe.            As indicated by the National Stock Exchange's fund flow reports at the start of each month, ETFs have taken off in a major way here in the United States. In the years following the initial launch of the first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the number of instruments available to U.S. investors has ballooned to over 1,000, and total assets have ascended above the $1 trillion mark. Around the world, the number of ETFs products has surpassed 2,000.           The majority of the products currently available are considered plain vanilla ETFs, boasting characteristics similar to SPY. However, the dramatic expansion of this industry has also ushered in a growing number of products that utilize increasingly complex techniques and assets in order to meet their desired goals.          ...

December 1st has been designated (as it is every year) to be \xe2\x80\x9cWorld AIDS Day\xe2\x80\x9d. That is a signal for the United Nations to put out a report on the state of the epidemic. This year, though, there are to be two reports.On November 21st UNAIDS, an agency created in 1996 to deal specifically with the then-newish disease, published its assessment of the situation. This reaffirmed what has become clear recently: that the epidemic is being beaten back by the widespread deployment of drugs, in combination with changes in the behaviour of those most at risk. The annual number of deaths has fallen to 1.8m, from its peak of 2.2m in 2005. New infections have also fallen, from a peak of 3.2m in 1997 to 2.7m last year. The report went on to outline what it calls an investment framework, designed to deal with the epidemic in the most cost-effective way. This builds on an analysis published in the  Lancet  in June by Bernhard Schwartl\xc3\xa4nder, UNAIDS\xe2\x80\x99s director of evidence, strategy and results.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been provided with 40,000  American Express Membership Rewards points  to find additional gifts or maybe a gift for myself! As a long time American Express Holder, I know these points can be redeemed for electronics, travel, and even gift cards. I rarely carry cash, as it disappears too easily, so I use my American Express card for almost every purchase, pay it off each month, and earn points on my shopping and everyday purchases.       American Express is encouraging shoppers to shop  Small Business Saturday \xc2\xa0and get a $25 credit back when you register an eligible American Express Card. Then use your card for a purchase of $25 or more at a small business on November 26 to receive your statement credit. Small businesses are the heart of the economy. They are the jobs creators and mean so much to many communities.    I used the zip code finder on the\xc2\xa0 Small Business Saturday \xc2\xa0Facebook page and came up with several small businesses in my area including Moser Jewelers, Pizza King, and Ace Hardware. All of these are within a five minute drive, which saves time and gas.     American Express would like to give one lucky Bargain Briana a $250 Gift Card of your choice!

law that made electronic images of paper checks just as legitimate as the paper checks themselves. As banks implemented the law, it saved time and money by allowing banks of first deposit to scan checks after a customers deposit them for verification with the originating bank. With an image of a check being accepted in place of a paper check, more banks have begun implementing a convenience to customers as well.    Businesses were the first customers to receive these benefits. For a business that receives thousands of checks every day, bringing the physical paper checks to a branch for deposit can be an expensive and time-consuming process, fraught with the possibility of security problems with the checks in transit. Banks have offered business the option of remote deposit. With this service, the customer can scan checks using a specialized imagine device (check scanner) and transmit the images securely over the Internet or a private network connection. The funds are then available immediately rather than overnight.     With this success, banks are in the process of extended similar features to non-business customers. With the proliferation of cell phones with built-in, high-megapixel camera, banks can now offer deposits using snapshots of checks sent via text message or custom smartphone apps. For these customers, no bulky desktop scanner is necessary, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to be home to make the deposit. You can effectively deposit checks from your mailbox down the street or from your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house on your birthday.     Business customers still have the advantages, with very few banks actively offering this service to non-business customers. The number of banks offering this service to consumers is increasing, however.    Remote deposit is most useful for banks that don\xe2\x80\x99t have local branches, like  these online banks . ING Direct, still bloggers\xe2\x80\x99  most favorite bank , is working to implement remote check deposit soon, but with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s planned acquisition by Capital One it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear when new features will be added.  ING Direct recently began offering paper checks  to customers, so remote deposit capture may not be too far behind.     Chase Bank  offers apps for iOS and Android devices. The application allows customers to log into their bank accounts. To deposit a check, take a picture of the front and back, and send the images securely to Chase using the application. The deposit will be recorded as pending immediately, though availability will depend on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s typical schedule, usually next business day availability for local checks. The availability schedule has several variables, though, so always check with the bank to determine when the funds you deposit will be available.     Ally Bank  has offered remote deposit for customers since April 2011, but the bank has just recently opened the program to all customers. Ally\xe2\x80\x99s eCheck Deposit service requires a scanner and some manual work, such as inputting the check amount (shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be automatically read when scanned?) and aligning the images. Ally plans to offer a mobile application soon.    The USAA Bank mobile application for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 7 includes a feature allowing remote deposit. Deposit@Mobile requires the customer to enter the check amount, take one photo of the front of the check and one photo of the back, and submit the images to the bank through the application. The bank will confirm the deposit amount.     Have you used your bank\xe2\x80\x99s remote deposit service? If so, what did you think of the experience?

The NBA\xe2\x80\x99s season is in shambles after a lockout by owners this summer dragged on\xc2\xa0and talks faltered; \xc2\xa0NBA officials canceled games through November 30. Yesterday, the NBA players\xe2\x80\x99 union  said it would disband , paving the way for an antitrust lawsuit against the owners \xe2\x80\x94 and raising the specter of a longer, messier fight.    Given the circumstances, some companies\xe2\x80\x99 disclosures are no-brainers:  Madison Square Garden (MSG)  owns the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s New York Knicks, and notes at one point in the  10-Q  it filed earlier this month that its NBA and National Hockey League teams together mean the company earns \xe2\x80\x9ca disproportionate share of its revenues\xe2\x80\x9d while those sports are in season. In a section on events after the end of the quarter, the company warns that failing to reschedule the games canceled so far would hurt the company\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal second-quarter results, and that further cancelations \xe2\x80\x9ccould have a material negative effect on our 2012 fiscal year results.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Moreover, the impact of any new revenue-sharing agreement adopted by the NBA after an agreement is reached (assuming one is, of course), is bound to affect the company as well, for better or worse.     Time Warner (TWX)  says the lockout didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a material impact on the most recent quarter\xe2\x80\x99s results, and optimistically predicts that it \xe2\x80\x9c does not expect it to have a material impact on the segment\xe2\x80\x99s operating results for the remainder of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d Not that all\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily well, as its  10-Q \xc2\xa0goes on to warn:        \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the longer-term impact of the NBA Lockout will be influenced by many factors including viewer ratings on TNT and advertising demand after the NBA Lockout ends. Because of the inherent uncertainties surrounding the NBA Lockout, the Company is unable to quantify the adverse impact that a prolonged NBA Lockout would have on the Networks segment s operating results.\xe2\x80\x9d       Others more peripheral to the off-court action (and all too soon, perhaps, the in-court legal action) tend to be less detailed in their warnings. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), the chicken-wing restaurant chain, simply warned in the  10-Q  that it filed on November 3 that \xe2\x80\x9cOur sales may be negatively affected by a disruption in the viewing of sporting events in our restaurants such as NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL due to strikes, lockouts, or labor disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d     Take Two Interactive (TTWO) , which sells sports-themed video games (and others), warned investors in a new risk-factor disclosure in its  10-Q  last week that \xe2\x80\x9cThe lockout by NBA owners could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.\xe2\x80\x9d It continued:       \xe2\x80\x9cThe NBA players union and the owners of the NBA teams are currently renegotiating their collective bargaining agreement, which expired following the 2010-2011 basketball season. Sales of 2K\xe2\x80\x99s annually released basketball game could be adversely affected due to the players being locked out and the reduction in the number of games in, or cancellation of, the 2011-2012 basketball season.\xe2\x80\x9d       Some companies are less explicit about the potential for harm than others. Video-game maker  Electronic Arts (ERTS)  also has contracts with the NBA (presumably for its  NBA Jam  games). Yet when it filed its  10-Q  the same day as Take Two, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the lockout. Of course, size may make a difference here: Electronic Arts is more than six times as big as Take Two, by market-cap.    As with so many things tied to the basketball dispute, how big a deal it all turns out to be depends on how long things drag out. So grab a seat, grab a drink, and enjoy the action as best you can.

myself,  I should have more job responsibility than this,  or,  I should be getting paid more than I am.  A disagreement with the boss over my skills, potential, and value to the organization created tension. For some people, this tension could be demotivating.     Dissatisfaction with career progress is often not something that could be blamed on the company on the boss. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s due to a bad fit between people, but more likely, employees can look at themselves to find the barrier to success in a career. Here are a few possibilities.      1. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t defined what you really want.  The first step to getting what you want out of a career is having a clear goal with a series of steps that will get you there. Knowing where you\xe2\x80\x99d like to be in your career helps you carry a sense of purpose in your job. If career advancement isn\xe2\x80\x99t important to you and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t found a need to define any goals, chances are your boss will keep you right where you are. If you have a goal in mind and are willing to put in the effort to show why you can accept more responsibilities, you have a better chance of moving ahead.     2. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed your career with your boss.  While the best organizations are partners with employees in the career-building process, the initiative must come from the employees. After you have clear career goals and a personal job-related mission, you must share that with the people in your organization who can help make that happen. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been too quiet about my desires in the past, and it has hurt me. After the fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had bosses tell me that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I wanted more responsibility. You may think you are showing the organization what you want through your actions, but in most cases, career desires need to be discussed explicitly.     3. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t passionate about your work.  Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to  follow passions . The missions that people are more likely to be passionate about are in fields in which is may be difficult to make a living. If your passion is fine art and the only job you can see yourself doing is a painting artistic landscapes, the competition to become one of the few painters who can earn a solid living on their art is tough. If your passion is in a field that pays well, like engineering, you have a better shot. Most people settle, and particularly in job markets that favor employers, people often take the jobs they can get and don\xe2\x80\x99t factor passion into the equation.     When you\xe2\x80\x99re not passionate about your work, it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult to summon up the intrinsic motivation that\xe2\x80\x99s required to not only do what\xe2\x80\x99s asked of you, but to go beyond the call of duty and excel, impressing the decision-makers in your organization. Find something about your job to be passionate about, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the job itself.     4. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t clarified why you deserve more.  Few people enjoy talking about themselves, particularly if it could be seen as bragging. Unfortunately, managers are busy and often don\xe2\x80\x99t see everything you do. This information should come out in annual performance reviews if your organization participates in this ritual, but these reviews tend to be formalities after management has already decided whether you receive a promotion or a raise. Set up time to review your progress with your boss on a much more frequent basis. Even if discussed informally, let her know that you\xe2\x80\x99re succeeding in ways that may not be immediately visible to a busy manager who focuses on many different people every day.    You may also need to make the connection for your manager. Explain not only what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done but the effect these activities had or will have on the organization.     5. You\xe2\x80\x99re not talking to the right decision-maker.  You may have had all the right discussions with the wrong individual. At one company, I knew my direct supervisor had a good idea of where I wanted to be, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the person who could help move my career in the right direction. While she always claimed to be working on my behalf, for my to see career success, I needed to have more open communication with her supervisors \xe2\x80\x94 not her direct supervisor, but her boss\xe2\x80\x99s boss, two layers in a corporate hierarchy up. When you need to jump ranks in order to move your career forward, it can tend to be intimidating. You don\xe2\x80\x99t deal with your boss\xe2\x80\x99s boss\xe2\x80\x99s boss on a regular basis, but she might be the one who needs to know what your goals and desires are. She needs to know how you\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded, and she needs to she your passion.     Relying on long communication chain may be respectful of rank, but in the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get you anywhere.    There might be other reasons you\xe2\x80\x99re unhappy with your career progress. Perhaps the company just isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good match for you. Perhaps your management plays favorites. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d succeed further working for yourself. Perhaps your management isn\xe2\x80\x99t lying when they say the company has no money. Rather than focus on these external factors, look within. If you believe the career path you\xe2\x80\x99re on is the right path for you and you\xe2\x80\x99re undervalued, you can change your approach to increase your chances of being noticed positively.

Republican critics of Barack Obama think this explains America\xe2\x80\x99s economic malaise. Scrap the rules, they claim, and the economy will spring to life. Nonsense, responds the Treasury.

She found no evidence that regulatory uncertainty is holding businesses back from hiring or investment; weak demand is the big culprit.  Yet regulation, if not a prime suspect, ...   \r\n')

Yesterday was another volatile day in the markets with Europe being the reason for the S&amp;P 500 to lose 21 points or 1.7%. As rates rise in Italy and Spain, traders are selling those bonds and other assets not wanting the risk. The European situation is leading to global recession fears and commodity markets sold off yesterday as well.

Over the past few years, the ability to connect first monkeys and then men to machines in ways that allow brain signals to tell those machines what to do has improved by leaps and bounds. In the latest demonstration of this, just published in the  Public Library of Science , Bin He and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota report that their volunteers can successfully fly a helicopter (admittedly a virtual one, on a computer screen) through a three-dimensional digital sky, merely by thinking about it. Signals from electrodes taped to the scalp of such pilots provide enough information for a computer to work out exactly what the pilot wants to do.That is interesting and useful. Mind-reading of this sort will allow the disabled to lead more normal lives, and the able-bodied to extend their range of possibilities still further. But there is another kind of mind-reading, too: determining, by scanning the brain, what someone is actually thinking about. This sort of mind-reading is less advanced than the machine-...    \r\n')

It is this spirit of grubby compromise, not lofty idealism, that will determine the future of the euro.That is because, as Joseph Schumpeter argued, a monetary system cannot be separated from the society that underlies it. Saving the euro is about much more than the optimal design of a currency area. Even as the euro zone fights to steady its banks and its sovereign borrowers, it must grapple with the profound choices that this special report has set out.

The team at Currency Online  Capital Flight and Forced Repatriation in Europe          Bruce Krasting had an excellent article over the weekend on ZeroHedge regarding  Capital Flight and Forced Repatriation  Put yourself in the mind of a Greek who had some savings in a local bank. What would you do? You would do whatever you could to get your money to high ground. It would be perfectly reasonable for you to do that. And that is exactly what the Greeks have done. They\xe2\x80\x99ve moved billions of Euros to Swiss banks in an effort to preserve their wealth. In the process they have crippled the Greek banks and have added to the downward spiral in Greece and the rest of the EU.      There was (IMHO) a very significant development on this front last week. A move is being made in Brussels to \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d the Swiss government/banks to transfer all of the assets of Greek citizens back to the Greek banks. For a Greek this means that your money is hostage. It has been functionally expropriated. It will be transferred into a banking system that is fraught with risk. Some portion of the money that goes back to Greece will certainly be lost.      I have talked with some who I know in Athens. They are out of their minds with this development.        BRUSSELS \xe2\x80\x94 The European Commission is helping Greece negotiate an agreement with Switzerland to repatriate as much as $81 billion believed to be hidden in Swiss bank accounts, a high level European Union executive body official said Nov. 17.          $81 billion? That\xe2\x80\x99s massive. This is not the shopkeeper or pensioner. This is big bucks and that means the Greek shippers. It is a fact that the Greek government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tax the foreign earnings of the shippers. Call that a mistake, but that is the law. As a result, the shippers have held huge bucks in Switzerland. It\xe2\x80\x99s not dirty money. Right or wrong, there was no legal tax on this.       The European Commission is working with Switzerland and Greece stop what it believes is an ongoing exodus of money from Greek bank accounts into Swiss and other offshore banking centers, the EU official said.       The only way to stop capital flight is to address the underlying causes of the flight. That can\xe2\x80\x99t happen in Greece for years. The alternative is to trap the money, force it to go where it is at most risk. The owner of the money will have no choice. Any rights they might have to preserve their assets will be abrogated.      I\xe2\x80\x99m amazed at this development. The Swiss government/banks are obligated to cooperate with EU tax authorities when there is evidence of tax fraud. But that is not what this is about. The people in Brussels and Bern know that. The fact is that the Greek tax system is so screwed up that there simply are no taxes levied on certain types of income/capital (the shippers). No doubt, some of the Greek cash that is in Switzerland is there because of tax avoidance. But the vast majority is simply safe haven money.      The word \xe2\x80\x9cRepatriation\xe2\x80\x9d sounds nice enough but really it means \xe2\x80\x9cTheft and expropriation\xe2\x80\x9d. There will be nothing voluntary about this. There will be little (if any) due process. If you have money in Greek banks, get it out now. If it\'s a small amount put it under the mattress. If it\'s a large amount, I am not sure where to tell you to put given pressure on Switzerland and illegal requests from the EU.

Because the market is saturated by flat-screen HDTV sets, says  CNNMoney , there aren\'t as many people out there who still want to buy new TVs. Combine that with the economic downturn and shoppers knowing when to nab items at their lowest prices, and manufacturers are dropping their prices to boost sales.      "It\'s a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Paul Gagnon, director of TV research at DisplaySearch. "But this year, softer demand is really taking a toll. Set makers\' profitability is pretty terrible right now, so there\'s lots of pressure to have a good holiday."      Predictions show some 32-inch LCD TVs going for as low as $200, with 60-inch sets going for as low as $600. Plasma screens are already more expensive, so those discounts won\'t be as steep as the LCD sets.      Low prices and less TVs sitting on warehouse shelves could also signal your choice being out of stock much faster than before as well, so shop early if you have a particular set you fancy.       Black Friday LCD TV prices will hit all-time lows  [CNNMoney]    \r\n')

It\xe2\x80\x99s been called class warfare, but there are other dimensions to the wealth gap than the spectrum that includes poor, working middle class, upper middle class, and wealthy.    The gap in wealth between young and old Americans is growing. Today, the Pew Research Center released new data showing the widening divide between Americans 35 years old or younger and Americans 65 and older. In 1984, the median net worth for the younger group was $11,521 (adjusted for inflation). The same year, the median net worth for the older group was $120,457. Net worth includes the value of all one\xe2\x80\x99s assets, including a house, minus the value of all one\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities, including student loan debt, credit card debt, and mortgages.     The passing of twenty-five years makes a difference. Today\xe2\x80\x99s median net worth \xe2\x80\x94 actually not today\xe2\x80\x99s number, but 2009\xe2\x80\xb2s number \xe2\x80\x94 for Americans 35 years old or younger is $3,662. That\xe2\x80\x99s a 68% decline! Today\xe2\x80\x99s youth is significantly less wealthy than the youth of the previous generation. In 2009, the older group\xe2\x80\x99s median net worth was $170,494, a 42% increase.      This is a comparison between age groups, which I would expect to be fairly similar to each other and similar to the past in terms of socioeconomic distribution. They would have to be, or the data would need to be standardized, for the numbers to have merit. There are great reasons to be happy about the increase of wealth in one group, but there is also a wide variety of reasons why young people (and I am one \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain 35 for just a few more months, if all goes well).       Unemployment within the young age group is high, while older workers are opting to stay in their jobs longer. In fact, recent graduates facing unemployment  may never reach their income potential . This problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t just going to go away when the job market improves.    Some call today\xe2\x80\x99s young adults (or old adolescents) the  Boomerang Generation . After college, they move back to their parents\xe2\x80\x99 house while looking for a job. They delay marriage and purchasing a house, both activities that are correlated with increased wealth. Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s recent graduates had jobs and houses, both of which contributed to gains over the past 25 years, particularly if the house was purchased in advance of the real estate bubble.     Student loan debt  is a much more significant part of a young person\xe2\x80\x99s life today than it was in 1984. College costs have far outpaced inflation, and lenders have always been keen to extend the availability of higher education to more students (otherwise known as borrowers and customers).    A college education is increasingly seen as the gateway to a good career in any field. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to compete in an information-based economy (opposed to a manufacturing-based economy) without a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree. A  high school diploma is no longer enough  for participation, particularly when companies can afford to be selective in hiring.        If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the younger group, the question should always be what you can do to reverse this trend. While there can be some results by supporting public policies that don\xe2\x80\x99t include bail-outs for the rich (socialization of losses) while cutting back resources for those with the least opportunity (privatizing the gains), it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put yourself in the best position possible so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to rely on public policy in your favor.    Assume you\xe2\x80\x99re a major league baseball player. (That will easily put you in a position where your wealth is quite healthy, but that\xe2\x80\x99s besides the point at the moment. Just go with the unexpected metaphor for a second.) You have three balls and two strikes, there are two outs, you\xe2\x80\x99re down by one run, the bases are loaded, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom of the ninth inning. You hit your next pitch to the shortstop. He mishandles the ball but gets it over to first base. It\xe2\x80\x99s a close play, a tie, but the umpire calls you out. Your manager rushes the field from the dugout to argue, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no use. You head back to the showers momentarily defeated.     It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to blame the umpire for getting the call wrong on such an important play. It\xe2\x80\x99s your job to perform well enough that there\xe2\x80\x99s never any question about whether you\xe2\x80\x99re safe or out. The \xe2\x80\x9csystem\xe2\x80\x9d that requires an umpire to make a snap judgment call on a close play is the same \xe2\x80\x9csystem\xe2\x80\x9d that makes it difficult for people to succeed financially. By  taking control of your finances , you make the \xe2\x80\x9csystem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the job market, the economy, politician\xe2\x80\x99s policies, to name a few societal aspects that aren\xe2\x80\x99t easily controlled by one person \xe2\x80\x94 less relevant to your long-term success.

It seems the runaway success of tablet computers has created an army of people who like nothing better to do than sit in their hotel rooms and stream videos, placing a huge demand on the network.One possible solution would be to install a tiered system, so guests would pay differing rates for Wi-Fi depending on their proposed activity.The lowest level, suitable for basic Internet requirements like checking e-mail, would be free, but other levels would be priced depending on bandwidth requirements. According to iBAHN [an internet-service provider for the hospitality industry], iPads consume four times more Wi-Fi data per month than the average smartphone.Having to pay to use the internet is one of the standard gripes of hotel guests, particularly in smarter establishments. But if they and their fellows will continue watching online videos into the small hours, they'll probably have to start paying.   \r\n")

Forbes recently listed Jobs as 39th on the Forbes 400, a list of the richest people in America, with a net worth of $7 billion. The author of Jobs\xe2\x80\x99 biography has been offering some insight into the billionaire\xe2\x80\x99s life in advance of the book\xe2\x80\x99s release. Some of the insight pertains to his attitude towards being rich.    As success came to Jobs and his colleagues, he observed the effect of the influx of wealth after Apple became a public company. An excess of money turned those who benefited from the company stock into \xe2\x80\x9cbizarro people\xe2\x80\x9d who purchased unnecessary things like Rolls Royces and plastic surgery. Jobs said he wanted to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cthat nutso lavish lifestyle.\xe2\x80\x9d Although he could afford to upgrade his lifestyle, Jobs lived with his family in a modest house in Palo Alto and didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire help or an entourage.     Jobs was\xe2\x80\x99t a complete stranger to living a finer life than most of the country could afford. He owned an apartment in The San Remo, a building in New York that featured residents including Steven Spielberg, Steve Martin, and Bono. Steve also owned a 17,000 square foot mansion in California. While he didn\xe2\x80\x99t own a Rolls Royce, he drove a 2008 Mercedes SL 55 AMG.    If Steve Jobs gave to charitable causes, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to know. There is virtually no record of Jobs sharing his wealth with causes needing funding, unlike many of the other billionaires outranking him. His direction for the posthumous distribution of his wealth is not public information. While many have criticized Jobs for not being a philanthropic role model, using his wealth to inspire others to focus on worthy causes, those with opposing viewpoints argue that his work building a successful company, creating wealth for others as well as revolutionary technology that, among other things, facilitate larger and faster contributions to these worthy causes, has done enough to improve the world.     It\xe2\x80\x99s a weak argument, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that caters to the more capitalistic approach to philanthropy. It relies on the idea that by providing salaries to his employees, they will go out and accomplish the philanthropic goals that Jobs did not set for himself. The argument assumes that organizations using iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks to collect funds wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been just as capable with other devices. Furthermore, the argument ignores that Jobs shut down corporate philanthropy on his return to Apple in order to save money. Did reducing charitable expenses play a significant role in saving the company?    Despite some fancy homes that often went unused and a moderately flashy car, Jobs seems to have taken the ideology of   The Millionaire Next Door   to heart. He continued to live his life mostly as he always had, not flaunting his wealth and not drawing too much attention to himself outside of his job responsibilities. For someone whose motto and company marketing slogan was \xe2\x80\x9cThink different,\xe2\x80\x9d Jobs appeared to desire to keep his differences unseen.      The Millionaire Next Door  changed the way people think about millionaires. Most millionaires worked hard building a company to earn money. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn it. They tend to blend in with their surroundings, not flaunt their wealth. Those who buy items as status symbols tend not to be wealthy (purchasing items on credit) or are wealthy only temporarily due to overspending. This idea of an understated millionaire, comfortable with his wealth and free of a need to prove himself, seems to fit the profile of Steve Jobs.    It\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps an approach that would befit anyone who found himself with any amount of wealth beyond what is needed to afford the necessities of life.

move his money from Wells Fargo to a credit union. She won\xe2\x80\x99t make the  Bank Transfer Day  November 5 goal, because the credit union\xe2\x80\x99s branch is planned to open November 7. This reader plans to be one of the new branch\xe2\x80\x99s first customers.     This reader wrote into Consumerism Commentary not to write about the effort to move away from big banks. She volunteers for charitable organizations and is wondering why there is no tax benefit available for volunteer time. Charitable financial contributions, such as cash, stocks, or property, are often tax-deductible if the organization receiving the donation is a registered non-profit. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken advantage of these tax deductions for several years, but for me, the purpose of contributing to non-profit organizations is not the tax deduction. The purpose is to legitimately help an organization whose mission is meaningful to me and my worldview.     I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lucky to be in a financial situation where contributing to organizations would not endanger my own bank account. Another method of donation that can have a great effect on an organization is spending time as a volunteer. In my experience, most non-profit organizations do not generate enough revenue from operations or fundraising to maintain a healthy payroll. They often rely on passionate volunteers to handle a large amount of work. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a large amount of money to provide an organization, you could be more beneficial to the group by offering your services as an unpaid volunteer.     If the more financially-comfortable money donors receive a benefit from the government for their assistance in the form of a tax deduction, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t volunteers receive a benefit related to the financial value of their time and work? Furthermore, the requirement that taxpayers need to itemize deductions in order to receive the charitable contribution deduction results in lower-income taxpayers, who are less likely to itemize, don\xe2\x80\x99t take a deduction they might deserve. This tax deduction favors upper middle class and above because they are more likely to have money to share and are more likely to itemize deductions.    The Congressional Budget Office agrees with me: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch tax incentives are limited, however, to the subset of taxpayers who itemize, and they favor high-income people, who face relatively higher marginal tax rates.\xe2\x80\x9d    While the feeling of being a positive force in the world should be a good enough motivator for working with organizations whose missions you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about, why should one form of contribution be encouraged through tax policy while another is not?    The War Revenue Act of 1917 established the charitable contributions deduction, only four years after the federal income tax as we know it was established. It\xe2\x80\x99s long been a part of the U.S. tax code and isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to go away, particularly because it\xe2\x80\x99s not only individuals who take advantage of the benefit. Some corporations can deduct up to 10% of their taxable income, and you can be sure that regardless of corporate goals, shareholders want their companies to reduce expenses for taxes as much as possible. Major contributions also constitute great public relations, helping prospective customers associate good deeds with the company.    Understanding that the tax deduction for charitable contributions would never go away without a major overhaul of the U.S. tax code, is there a place for additional deductions for time and effort spent volunteering?    There would be a few challenges.        Fraud.  With a financial transaction, the bank has a record that can be submitted to the IRS for proof if called upon to do so. Without an independent verification of the time spent volunteering, it would be too easy to submit false documentation and take advantage of the system.     Valuation.  How do you put a value on one hour spent as a volunteer? The value of time has always generated good discussion. Is an hour from a CEO who sacrifices the time he could be spending building a company, creating jobs, to be a volunteer more valuable than an hour from a high school student who is looking for opportunities to enhance his college applications? If the CEO spends his time stuffing envelopes with fundraising postcards and the student takes an hour to organize an event having a direct impact on an elderly community, is each hour rated the same?       These issues are not insurmountable, but it would take some planning to develop a method of making the tax deduction verifiable and fair. With tax policy set by lobbyists, we may never see an arrangement like this within the tax code. Unless corporations were to find value in spending time rather than money for charitable causes, there would not be enough pressure on politicians to change the rule.    The reader who brought this idea to my attention also asked the following: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we make suggestions to the tax laws?  Is there a process for raising such an issue?\xe2\x80\x9d    The first stop is your local Representative and Senators. Send letters, call their offices, and get more people to do the same. Laws can be changed by citizens, but it would take a significant effort. If you feel strongly about the issue, convince others to take up the cause with you.    It\xe2\x80\x99s almost Thanksgiving, so take a page from Arlo Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s  Alice\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant.  For people to change even a small aspect of the tax code, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a movement. If you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about this idea, start websites, inspire people to follow, and change the world.

0.9070867599319727, 0.29753710375345443, '   European officials have had enough of the technocrat leadership in Greece. They have given a week for Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy party, and member of the coalition to sign a document saying he will support the European Union debt plan.      He says he will support the plan (with modifications). The EU wants a signature now, with no changes.       Does a Signature Even Matter?        Other than pigheadedness on behalf of the EU, does a signature even matter? Why? The next government can easily vote to undo whatever this government does. Will Samaras remain in power? Is his signature binding on the next parliament (or even this one)?      I will have more questions in a moment but first consider a couple of articles.       EU Gives Deadline on Signatures       Ekathimerini reports  EU sets deadline for signatures     European officials insisted on Tuesday that party leaders in Greece\xe2\x80\x99s coalition government must provide written guarantees expressing their commitment to a new European Union debt plan before a Eurogroup summit next Tuesday to unlock crucial rescue funding. But center-right New Democracy appeared unmoved and the right-wing Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) -- the third party in the coalition -- appeared to harden its stance against the country\xe2\x80\x99s creditors.      Sources in Brussels told Kathimerini that the EU decided to send Athens the ultimatum after talks between European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and New Democracy\xe2\x80\x99s vice president Stavros Dimas, who is also foreign minister, failed to secure a shift in the stance of ND president Antonis Samaras, who has refused to offer written guarantees to Brussels, saying his word should be enough.      Eurogroup chief Jean-Claude Juncker, who received Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Strasbourg, said he hoped party leaders would fulfill EU demands by Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cWould there be no cross-party agreement, that disbursement of course could not take place,\xe2\x80\x9d Juncker said, referring to an 8-billion-euro loan without which Greece faces default next month.      There was pressure from elsewhere too. Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said his country would bar further aid unless Samaras changes his tune. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to see a signature from Mr Samaras\xe2\x80\xa6 otherwise, as far as I am concerned, they will get no money. Absolutely not.\xe2\x80\x9d But ND spokesman Yiannis Michelakis indicated that ND\xe2\x80\x99s leader was unmoved. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to add on the issue of the signature that is being asked of Samaras,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.      Meanwhile the leader of LAOS, Giorgos Karatzaferis, shifted from his earlier suggestion that he would do \xe2\x80\x9ceverything necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to secure crucial loans, saying that instead of signing a letter, he would write an article outlining his commitments in his party\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper.  Samaras Won\'t Sign, Sends Letter Instead       Athens News reports  Samaras won\'t sign, EPP letter published     As the pressure mounts on the major Greek party leaders to provide written support for the October 26/27 eurozone deal, New Democracy (ND) president Antonis Samaras has reiterated his stance that he will not sign such a statement.      ND party spokesman Yiannis Mihelakis stressed on Tuesday that he has nothing further to add on the issue of  Samaras\' signature over commitments requested by the EC-ECB-IMF \'troika\'. Mihelakis added that Samaras has made specific statements saying he backs the October 26 EU summit agreement, adding that no request has been made on behalf of the European Union as regards the ND leader\xe2\x80\x99s signature.       In the letter, Samaras underlines the fact that he supports Prime Minister Lucas Papademos and the targets of fiscal adjustment but notes that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain policies have to be modified\xe2\x80\x9d.  Policy Changes?       Who blinks first? Samaras or the EU?      While pondering that question, consider this logic from my friend Bran who every day sends me links like those above.      Bran writes ...    Imagine a US bill launched by the Democrats affecting international shipping. Suppose the bill gets a mixed vote and passes.       Along come the Chinese who are part beneficiaries of the bill and they then insist not just the President sign it, but also demand the head of the Republican party to do so, or they will not abide by their reciprocally enacted legislation.  Just imagine that setup and tell me how Speaker of the House John Boehner or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell might react.      Even if the Congressional leaders did sign such a document, would it be binding on the next Congress?      In the case of Greece, elections will be held early next year (supposedly). With all these demands and all this political posturing, one has to wonder.      I for one hope Samaras holds firm and does not sign. The quicker the Eurozone blows up, the better it will be for everyone.

To the Congress:    As further and  urgently necessary step in the program to promote economic recovery, I  ask the Congress for legislation to protect small home owners from  foreclosure and to relieve them of a portion of the burden of excessive  interest and principal payments incurred during the period of higher  values and higher earning power.    Implicit in the legislation which  I am suggesting to you is a declaration of national policy. This policy  is that the broad interests of the Nation require that special  safeguards should be thrown around home ownership as a guarantee of social and economic stability, and that to protect  home owners from inequitable enforced liquidation in a time of general  distress is a proper concern of the Government.    The legislation I  propose follows the general lines of the farm mortgage refinancing bill.  The terms are such as to impose the least possible charge upon the  National Treasury consistent with the objects sought. It provides  machinery through which existing mortgage debts on small homes may be  adjusted to a sound basis of values without injustice to investors, at  substantially lower interest rates and with provision for postponing  both interest and principal payments in cases of extreme need. The  resources to be made available through a bond issue to be guaranteed as  to interest only by the Treasury, will, it is thought, be sufficient to  meet the needs of those to whom other methods of financing are not  available. At the same time the plan of settlement will provide a  standard which should put an end to present uncertain and chaotic  conditions that create fear and despair among both home owners and  investors.    Legislation of this character is a subject that demands our most earnest, thoughtful and prompt consideration.      Source :    Franklin D.

Yes indeed, the real deadline is not tomorrow but rather 2013. A lot can happen by then, including a decision to not cut anything at all.       Boehner\'s Moral Obligation Goes Out the Window     Boehner, an Ohio Republican, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, have said they support the trigger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe markets should know that the deficit reduction will occur,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said on Nov. 3. Boehner has said he \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally\xe2\x80\x9d feels a moral obligation to uphold the cuts.     So much for Boehner\'s "Moral Obligations" and Pelosi\'s promise to do something.       McCain Goes One Step Further        McCain, even went one step further.     Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, are already trying to use legislative levers to stop the automatic cuts from taking effect.   Cuts? Who Needs Cuts?       Clearly McCain is a hypocrite. Were it not for an even worse setup in Europe, the US dollar would be taking a pounding here.       Expect US Debt Downgrades        Look for further downgrades of US debt by Moody\'s, Fitch, and S&amp;P.      To even things out, look for downgrades of France as well.       "Super Committee" Idiocy       Please consider what I had to say on July 25, 2011 in  "Super Committee" is Super Idiocy      Super Committee Nonsense       I  thought it was Tim Geithner who came up with the "Super Committee" idea  but he was merely silly enough to latch on to it. The latest  hare-brained scheme comes from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  and Majority Leader Harry Reid.      Constitutional concerns aside, abdicating legislative responsibility to a  super committee with super powers is idiotic. Besides didn\'t the  Gang-of-Six just attempt to do something similar? And where did that  plan go after a year of wrangling?      Is a 12 man committee more likely to agree to something than a 6 man committee?  Anyone who thinks so has mush for brains.      Of  course the whole idea might be to save face for both parties so that no  one has to do anything but point fingers and blame the other side for  lack of sensible action.      Each passing day delivers more reasons to be disgusted with leaders of both parties.  Mission a Brilliant Success, Achieves 100% of Its Goals       The Super Committee accomplished nothing, as expected, and more importantly, as designed.  Neither political party really wanted to do anything about the deficit (because it would cost them votes). By D.C. standards this mission was a "brilliant success". It achieved its purpose, which was to do nothing. Both parties got the smoke-and-mirrors delay they wanted, while pointing fingers at the other side.

What's most interesting about his thinking is the way he orients his model of economic activity around balance of payment dynamics. Here's an example:Since most global consumption comes from the US, Europe and Japan, the collapse in their demand will ultimately be very painful for the BRICs and the rest of the developing world. The latter have postponed the impact of contracting consumption by increasing domestic investment, in some cases very sharply, but the purpose of higher current investment is to serve higher future consumption. In many countries, most notably China, the higher investment will itself limit future consumption growth, and so with weak consumption growth in the developed world, and no relief from the developing world, today\xe2\x80\x99s higher investment will actually exacerbate the impact of the current contraction in consumption.Mr Pettis argues that the pivot around which the BRIC economies (and China especially) swing is reliance on advanced-country demand. As that anchor (sorry, mixing metaphors) becomes dislodged, BRIC economies will face difficult internal structural changes.You might not buy all of his predictions, but it's a compelling way to view the big trends in the global economy, and especially the ...   \r\n")

Jon the Saver, a personal finance blogger at  Free Money Wisdom .  His mission is to spread financial wisdom and help people get their financial lives under control.  In his down time he loves a mean game of Scrabble and spending quality time with his fiancee.     I\xe2\x80\x99m probably the only personal financial blogger who works in the construction industry.  It may sound like a strange combination, but it actually makes sense.  There are so many financial aspects to construction, it blows my mind.    To give you some background, I currently work for a Fortune 500 general contractor in the heavy civil industry.  We work on large scale projects like highways, bridges, and power plants.  I graduated college with a degree in Construction Management and love what I do.  How many people do you know can say that?  Well, I can and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of it!  I love the ability to go out on a project site and then be able to come back indoors.  I would hate cubicle life and feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m wired for construction.     To say that the construction industry has revolutionized my personal finances is pretty bold.  As bold as it may be, it\xe2\x80\x99s true.  I have always had big picture personal finance principles as my foundation, but construction has really taught me a lot about personal finance, some of it from studying long hours in college and some of it from getting my work boots dirty in the field.    Let\xe2\x80\x99s dig our boots in and explore this revolution.    1. Execution without planning will result in failure    You can try to execute, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have proper planning, it\xe2\x80\x99s doomed to fail.  In construction this happens when someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do his job and forgets to plan accordingly.  This could be as simple as a missing checklist or as serious as not ordering enough concrete.  Another big one is planning for safety.  You never want injuries on your job site.  If you don\xe2\x80\x99t engineer out the risks of an operation, how can you be confident in your execution?     Effect on finances:  This is everything from proper retirement planning to education on personal finances.  I mean, why do you read this blog? Probably because you want to plan for your future.  Planning is everything.  If you have a good plan, you\xe2\x80\x99re destined for success.    2. 80/20 rule applies to your finances    I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge believer in the 80/20 rule, also known as  the Pareto Principle .  I first heard of this rule from a professor in college.  The basic idea is that 80% of your results come from 20% of your work.  More and more I\xe2\x80\x99m finding this to be true. There are only a handful of decisions that are really going to affect you on a construction job.  Things like a concrete pour are extremely critical, whereas a meeting on the door paint may be pushed to another week.      Effect on finances:  Very few of your decisions will really have a big effect on your finances.  I would say the top two decisions that fall into the 80/20 rule are living a debt-free life and saving 15 to 25 percent of your income for retirement.  Now, there are others, but those two come to mind right now.  Take the 80/20 rule and apply it to your financial life. You might even start to feel less stressed.    3. Where are you headed without a schedule?    A construction project is 100 percent schedule-driven.  Without an organized schedule, how will you know what will be happening the next week?  How will you know when to mobilize big equipment?  These issues are solved by keeping an in-depth schedule and maintaining it.  Most of our meetings on a job site are schedule-related, and there is good reason for that.     Effect on finances:  Your retirement timeline will determine what your savings goals and personal schedule looks like.  Knowing this timeline will also tell you what percentages you want to be in various asset classes for stocks and bonds.  For example, a 20 year old should be invested in 20 percent bonds and 80 percent stocks.  Now, take a 50 year old.  This person would want to be invested in 50 percent bonds and 50 percent stocks.  Knowing your schedule has a huge impact on your investment decisions.    4. Know your costs    On a construction project, knowing your costs will make or break your bottom line.  Everything down to the office supplies need to be accounted for.  Not only is this a good practice for keeping good records, but it ensures that you get paid by the owner.  Without a record of your costs, your boat is going to sink and sink fast.     Effect on finances:  When you relate this concept to your finances, this means keeping track of all expenses and where your money is going.  Knowing where your money is going is crucial to saving effectively and ensuring you don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the trap of debt.  If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to start for tracking your costs, I recommend  Mint.com .    5. Protect your assets    As a general contractor, we own much of our heavy equipment, everything from bulldozers to mobile cranes.  Part of the responsibility of owning these pieces of equipment is to protect our assets.  We maintain this equipment and always keep the moving parts up to date.  A broken bulldozer is useless in the eyes of a general contractor.     Effect on finances:  This one is more human related.  Part of personal finances is  keeping your body and mind healthy  so you can enjoy your retirement or enjoy your hard earned money now!  I\xe2\x80\x99m always trying to explain this to people.  Your body is your greatest asset.  Without it, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for some serious repercussions.  Eat healthy and exercise on a weekly basis.  You want to enjoy your \xe2\x80\x9cglory years\xe2\x80\x9d right?    Who knew that construction had so many lessons that you could apply to personal finances?  I hope you enjoyed this post.  Now you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not so crazy to be in construction and love personal finance!

He did so despite (or perhaps because of) his promise to be more rigorous than the outgoing Socialist government of Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis Rodr\xc3\xadguez Zapatero in imposing austerity to keep Spain in the euro zone. Yet Mr Rajoy knows that, with the markets in a eurofunk and bond yields at eye-watering highs, mere promises count for little.His victory was in part a tribute to the dogged persistence and quiet moderation of a man who has led his party for eight years.

Here's the explanation from Darth Vader's desk:    AT&T Inc. and Deutsche Telekom AG are continuing to pursue the sale of Deutsche Telekom's U.S. wireless assets to AT&T and are taking this step to facilitate the consideration of all options at the FCC and to focus their continuing efforts on obtaining antitrust clearance for the transaction from the Department of Justice either through the litigation pending... or alternate means.        The DOJ trial is currently slated to start in mid-February.  If the deal survives that process, AT&T says it will then revisit getting approval from the FCC.       Earlier this week, the FCC declared its intention to hold an administrative hearing, essentially a trial wherein AT&T would need to prove that the merger is in the public interest, at the conclusion of the DOJ trial.     \r\n")

Mom-and-pop independent stores should be your first stop if you need hand-holding for a major electronics purchase. With the exception of prices (which were average), independents were above par in every respect in our recent survey of more than 22,000 shoppers on where to buy electronics.

The development set the stage for oral arguments by March and a decision in late June, in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign\xe2\x80\xa6    \xe2\x80\xa6     Appeals from three courts had been vying for the justices\xe2\x80\x99 attention , presenting an array of issues beyond the central one of whether Congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so-called individual mandate.     The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from just one decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta,     the only one so far striking down the mandate.  The decision , from a divided three-judge panel, said the mandate overstepped Congressional authority and could not be justified by the constitutional power \xe2\x80\x9cto regulate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto lay and collect taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d     The appeals court went no further, though, severing the mandate from the rest of the law.     On Monday, the justices agreed to decide not only whether the mandate is constitutional but also whether, if it is not, how much of the balance of the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, must fall along with it.     \xe2\x80\xa6    On Monday, the justices agreed to consider that question. The justices also said they would consider an intriguing threshold issue.    In September, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va.,  ruled that it was premature to decide the case  in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, a federal law that bars suits \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\xe2\x80\x9d The Supreme Court had interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d very broadly for purposes of the law.     If the Fourth Circuit ruling is correct, individuals may not challenge the individual mandate until the first penalty is due in April 2015. On Tuesday, a dissenting judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  also endorsed that position .          \r\n')

Gen Y Capital Partners is looking for investment opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cFor Gen Y, by Gen Y\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to help start-up businesses grow.    Any entrepreneur in the appropriate age group should consider this offer. The firm will pay your student loan debt for three years and eliminate your everyday expenses by providing a living space for you on a great university campus like Princeton University. Not having to worry about student loan bills and living expenses allows a young entrepreneur to focus solely on building a business from the ground up without financial distraction.     There has been a trend lately of encouraging the fostering of entrepreneurs from the corporate world. With few job opportunities and an economy where companies are under pressure to produce more with fewer resources, workers are frustrated with corporate life and some leave that world behind in favor of working for themselves. Recent college graduates are faced with a tough job market for someone with little experience and are turning to living at home and trying to determine their next steps. The time couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better to foster the independent approach that, when successful, can be financially and emotionally rewarding.    The entrepreneurial path isn\xe2\x80\x99t for everyone, and I take issue with articles and gurus that suggest that every individual could solve their financial concerns by becoming making their own passion or interests a full-time job. Being a successful entrepreneur requires personality traits that not everyone is interested in fostering. But for those who are likely to succeed in building their own business and are within the target age group, Gen Y Capital Partners is worth a look.    In order to receive this funding, an entrepreneur and his or her business must meet several qualifications.       A solid management team with business knowledge.    A scalable business model.    Existing paying clients.    A likelihood that potential competitors are limited.    A defined exit strategy.       Gen Y Capital Partners are also offering peer mentoring.  Mentoring is one of the most beneficial methods  of improving your human capital measurement, and can have real results when building a business.     Here is how the application process works, according to Scott Gerber, founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council and Gen Y Capital partner:     When people go to  www.GenYCap.com  and they go to the \xe2\x80\x9cApply\xe2\x80\x9d section, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked to supply their executive summary, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll also be asked if they want to submit an up to one-minute YouTube video pitch so they can be seen and heard about their business along with some basic information. Starting in 2012, we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin consideration on which businesses we\xe2\x80\x99ll invest in\xe2\x80\xa6 The average investments will be between $15,000 and $50,000 plus the loan reduction, and in select ventures we\xe2\x80\x99ll invest up to $250,000\xe2\x80\xa6 Our investment company will take an equity percentage based on the business and the investment that we make.     For a start-up business, $50,000 could be a sizable investment, and the elimination of student loan obligations and living expenses can make that investment go further.

In 1975 Dr Moore modified his prediction, observing that component density was doubling every two years. In practical terms, the result is that personal-computer performance doubles every 18 months, and has done so for decades, a prediction commonly known as Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law. As computers have become mobile devices, however, their users are increasingly concerned about battery life as well as raw performance. So they will welcome a new analysis, by Jonathan Koomey of Stanford University and his colleagues, which seems to have uncovered a deeper law relating to the energy-efficiency of computers, dating back to the era of vacuum tubes. The researchers found that the electrical efficiency of computing has doubled every 1.6 years since the mid-1940s. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means that for a fixed amount of computational power, the need for battery capacity will fall by half every 1.6 years,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Dr Koomey.

The German \xe2\x80\x9cnear miss\xe2\x80\x9d failed auction yesterday has set off several new developments and pressures \xe2\x80\x93 This is a major thing clearly, and some media even speculate it could change the mighty Bundesbanks\xe2\x80\x99 perception of reality.      Close to home, Germany now trades ABOVE Denmark on 10 year government debt by 10 basis points!  However, there is reason to believe this more a function of the illiquid markets than an endorsement of the Danish economy, where the fiscal imbalances continues to expand negatively (Unlike Sweden!)       Spread difference 10 year Denmark minus 10 year Germany                It has also increased the pressure from France to get the ECB more involved \xe2\x80\x93 I fail to see link between the German auction and this, but never the less the French political machine is always firmly behind the concept of \xe2\x80\x9c Dirigism \xe2\x80\x9d and in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting between Merkel, Sarkozy and Monti the topic surely will be touched again.      It\xe2\x80\x99s important in historic context to remember that the only true role a central has is to \xe2\x80\xa6 print money \xe2\x80\x93 why else have it?      I remain committed to my Chapter 11 concept as one of the few ways to break this deadlock.      Safe travels,      Steen For a discussion of the "Chapter 11" concept, please see  Perfect Storm the Most Likely Scenario; Is Europe Set to Declare a Chapter 11 in Early 2012?       Steen is correct regarding the only true role of central banks. It is precisely why they they should be eliminated. Far from being "inflation fighters" they are the very source of inflation.      More correctly: Fractional Reserve Lending and Central Bank Printing do not "cause" inflation, they "are" inflation.      Deflation is the destruction of credit and debt from the preceding boom.

When compared to last year, the more than 42 million people planning to travel for the upcoming holdiay, represents a four percent increase from the 2010 total of 40.9 million.       \xe2\x80\x9cAs consumers weigh the fear of economic uncertainty and the desire to create lasting family memories this holiday, more Americans are expected to choose family and friends over frugality,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill Sutherland, vice president, AAA Travel Services.       Still, the projected 42.5 million people who plan represents a slow climb back from the decade-low number of 37.8 million who traveled for Thanksgiving in 2008. And the number of people expected to travel this year is still below historical averages.        Do you plan to travel for Thanksgiving? If so, how far from home are you going?

     It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to focus on the personal policies that help improve your net worth immediately. Saving money, investing thoughtfully, and earning income affect your bottom line immediately. This view can be shortsighted occasionally. Focusing effort on your  personal human capital  can have a greater affect on your net worth over the course of the rest of your life. There are certain things anyone can do to improve the probability of being financially secure in the future. Focusing on your health can ensure you\xe2\x80\x99ll have many income-earning years in the future.     There is  much about your finances you can control , but some circumstances, while they can be prepared for, are difficult to predict. The same is true about health. The best anyone can do is take good care of his mind and body to reduce the chance that health will be a major concern.      Get health insurance.  If you do not have a job that offers group health insurance and do not have access through a family member, finding coverage can be expensive. When I left my corporate job last year, I investigated prices for individual health coverage in New Jersey, and coverage similar to what I had at the company cost over one thousand dollars a month. Basic coverage was significantly less, but the benefits were not as comprehensive as what I had with my prior HMO plan. When I left the job, I had access to COBRA coverage, which extended the same coverage I had, but the premiums were no longer subsidized. The monthly fee was expensive, but manageable.      Don\xe2\x80\x99t make any insurance payment mistakes.  If you are paying for health insurance coverage on your own, create an automated payment plan. One missed payment can give the health insurance company cause to cancel your coverage.     Reduce your intake of unhealthy food.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a health fanatic. You can make some easy changes to your diet that should improve your health over the long term. For the most part, I no longer drink soda, opting for water instead. I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself a health expert, and there are still many improvements to my diet that could result in increased health, but my plan for now is to be more conscious about the food I eat.      Stay active.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re not an athlete, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to undertake a massive campaign for exercise. If you have a job that keeps you sitting at a desk for most of the day, though, consider compensating for a sedentary lifestyle by taking some time to keep your muscles active. I  joined a gym recently  and I\xe2\x80\x99m still looking to find a routine that works for me. I have lost some weight and I feel healthier in general. The challenge is maintaining this with a work and travel schedule that keeps me busy, making it difficult for me to set aside regular time.    I don\xe2\x80\x99t always recommend joining a gym, though. Some people may find the environment motivating, but for others, it will cost less money in the long run to  exercise independently, without a monthly fee. The most important aspect is to stay active, regardless of how it\xe2\x80\x99s accomplished. Even if you find the best way for you to stay active is to join a gym, spending that money now to stay in shape could pay off in the future through improved health.     Get good sleep, quality and quantity.  I combined a good mattress, good sheets, and good pillows and was halfway towards improving my sleep. Throughout my life, I had never really achieved quality sleep. As far back as middle school, I often stayed up late at night computer programming and running a bulletin board system. This lasted throughout high school. In college, I spent my days in class, studying, and practicing, while spending many nights designing and maintaining websites. Later on, my time outside of my day jobs was also spent working on websites. All of this left very little time for sleep, and the sleep I did get wasn\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable.    I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend a lot of money to fix this problem. Finding the right mattress took some time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied with the one I have now. I discovered that \xe2\x80\x9cmemory foam\xe2\x80\x9d pillows don\xe2\x80\x99t bother my neck and back as other pillows. Someone introduced me to cotton jersey knit sheets, and I find these much more comfortable than other cotton or satin sheets. Once I was able to combine this with seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night, I wake up refreshed and I can get through everyday without becoming exhausted.    From  Forbes :     Talking of getting a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep \xe2\x80\x94 critical for boosting memory \xe2\x80\x94 the key is to let melatonin do its trick. That\xe2\x80\x99s a versatile hormone produced by the brain. It synchronizes the biological clock, regulates sleep and is a powerful antioxidant. Scientists believe it strengthens the immune system and has a strong link to preventing depression, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and sexual dysfunction.      Visit your doctor and dentist.  Just having insurance isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. Visit the doctor twice a year for check-ups and get any tests appropriate for your age. The same applies to the dentist. When I was in college, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I visited a dentist once. I returned to my home state of New Jersey several months after graduating to work at my new job, and after receiving insurance, I made my first appointment with a dentist in years. It was a good thing my teeth and gums weren\xe2\x80\x99t in worse shape than they were. Flossing and brushing keeps gums healthy, and healthy gums help increase the chance of maintaining the health of the rest of your body.     Quit smoking (or don\xe2\x80\x99t start).  While everyone seems to have an anecdote to share about a two-pack-a-day smoker who lived beyond 100 years, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the norm. You can improve your health \xe2\x80\x94 and your short-term finances \xe2\x80\x94 by quitting smoking. You\xe2\x80\x99ll save money today, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be healthier so that you can continue earning money, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel healthier. Quitting may not b an easy feat, but all ex-smokers I know are happy they made the decision.     Manage your stress.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been more stressed in my life than I have been as a business owner. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my way through my life until this point generally avoiding stress, not letting myself get too emotionally involved in my work. It\xe2\x80\x99s different when it\xe2\x80\x99s my own business, and dealing stress has been difficult for me. I use relaxation techniques to help deal with stress, particularly when I know the situations that cause stress can\xe2\x80\x99t be avoided.     Staying healthy can reduce your downtime at work and help you make the most of your income-earning years. Your health might help you extend those years, as well. While I get the impression that the media emphasize health too much, to the point at which unhealthy individuals as marginalized. In order to be healthy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look like an actor or athlete, but paying attention to these few core health principles can be worthwhile for anyone interested in being financially secure. A good attitude towards health and a few healthy habits can increase your human capital.

His departure (as of October 31) was  announced  November 1 as part of a broader reshuffling of the company\xe2\x80\x99s various operations, and the press release describes him as having \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dvoluntarily resigned his position to pursue other opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the oldest business clich\xc3\xa9s in the book, of course, but sometimes even clich\xc3\xa9s can be true, after all.    Voetsch gets $4.1 million in cash to help him along with whatever those opportunities might be. He\xe2\x80\x99s also getting $3.2 million more to cash out his unvested restricted stock, and company health insurance for 12 months. In return, he won\xe2\x80\x99t compete with Knight Capital for six months and won\xe2\x80\x99t try to poach employees for a year \xe2\x80\x94 and he\xe2\x80\x99s promised to avoid badmouthing the company forever. The company can\xe2\x80\x99t diss him in public either, but we were struck by just how specific the limitations are on Voetsch. The  agreement \xc2\xa0itself spells out:       \xe2\x80\x9cYou agree you shall not issue, authorize, or condone comments or statements to the press concerning Knight or any of its parents, affiliates, officers, or vectors other than to say \xe2\x80\x98I cannot comment.\xe2\x80\x99 You shall notify Knight\xe2\x80\x99s General Counsel if you have been contacted by the press or broadcast media.       As regular readers might guess by now, this kind of payout doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite mesh with the proxy\xe2\x80\x99s description of the severance Voetsch would ordinarily be eligible for under various scenarios. Termination \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner which would have made [him] eligible for severance\xe2\x80\x9d would have secured him a maximum of 26 weeks\xe2\x80\x99 salary, or $125,000, had he been canned last December 31. Retirement would have accelerated the vesting of some of his restricted stock units, but only to the tune of $1.4 million as of the end of 2010. This is how the proxy wraps up the section that describes severance terms for Voetsch and others:       \xe2\x80\x9cOther than in respect of accelerated vesting of equity awards as described above, none of the Named Executive Officers are entitled to any compensation or benefits on a voluntary termination of employment, death, or disability that is different than the compensation and benefits provided to Company employees generally. \xe2\x80\x9c       Amusingly, as is so often the case, the agreement also includes detailed prohibitions on disclosing its terms \xe2\x80\x94 so specific that it creates a explicit exception allowing Voetsch to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscuss this Agreement and Release with your spouse \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] your attorneys\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d, among others. Never mind that the company would be filing the document with the Securities and Exchange Commission for all to see.    As we mentioned, Voetsch isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first Knight executive to get big bucks on the way out. In August of last year, Sonya  footnoted  the departure of Gary Katcher, who had joined the company a couple years before with its acquisition of boutique bond brokerage\xc2\xa0Libertas Holdings. He got $4.6 million cash, and was also cashed out of 114,426 restricted shares \xe2\x80\x94 and Knight Capital promised to invest up to $12.5 million in a hedge-fund created by Katcher within two years.    Given that neither side is supposed to say much of anything, this filing is likely to be the last word we have on the subject, at least until the company\xe2\x80\x99s next proxy comes out, detailing payments made to executives this year. Maybe then we\xe2\x80\x99ll also find out what happened with the $12.5 million that Knight promised to invest with Katcher last August.

today\xe2\x80\x99s best writers focusing on personal finance. Originally keeping a great blog at  behaviorgap.com , The Behavior Gap has moved to the New York Times, and early next year, Carl will release his first book. Look for   The Behavior Gap: Simple Ways to Stop Doing Dumb Things with Money   on January 3, 2012.     Carl\xe2\x80\x99s articles on Behavior Gap and now his New York Times column tend to focus on the psychological aspects of money and are usually centered around cocktail-napkin sketches like the example below illustrating how as investors we expect trends to continue into the future.         Carl Richards is also a financial planner, and in a recent New York Times feature, he uses an example from his own life to explain how people continue to behave irrationally about money even when they know better. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good indication of why a healthy approach to your finances requires much more than knowing, \xe2\x80\x9cspend less than you earn.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99d like to think that building wealth is as simple as that, but if that were true, anyone who could do simple arithmetic would be financially secure over time.    While close friends and family were likely aware of Carl\xe2\x80\x99s housing situation a few years ago, he\xe2\x80\x99s just now sharing his experiences with the public. How could a smart financial planner lose his house in Las Vegas? How could someone strangers rely on for financial advice find himself underwater on his mortgages? It\xe2\x80\x99s not such a stretch when you understand human behavior.        We feel comfortable in crowds.  When everyone else in our closest circle is behaving a certain way, we feel safe if we are taking the same approach and making the same decisions.     We expect trends to continue (see the sketch above) even though reality often differs.  In Carl\xe2\x80\x99s case, he expected \xe2\x80\x94 and everyone around him expected \xe2\x80\x94 real estate prices to continue climbing.     We trust the professionals.  Carl qualified for a mortgage at more than 100 percent of his house\xe2\x80\x99s purchase price, according to his mortgage broker. He wanted to believe the salesperson, despite knowing his fee was based on the loan value. Even against his better judgment, he over-borrowed.       Carl\xe2\x80\x99s story also illustrates how easy it is to falsely judge someone\xe2\x80\x99s financial choices from the outside. Now with clients in dire financial situations, as a financial planner Carl is less likely to judge their choices to spend money. Their continued vacations despite the lack of money in the bank could be what is saving their family \xe2\x80\x94 or their lives.    You can get caught up in the excitement when everyone around you seems to be making choices which look crazy on paper but seem to be resulting in short-term success. Carl\xe2\x80\x99s example is the real estate frenzy in Las Vegas in 2003:     It felt a little crazy to be shopping for houses that cost half a million dollars, but my income was growing rapidly. Everywhere I looked, people were being rewarded for buying as much house as they could possibly afford, and then some. There was this excitement in the air, almost like static. I started to think that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy a house right then, I would never be able to afford one\xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99d go to open houses for $400,000 homes and see lines of couples in their late 20s \xe2\x80\x94 younger than we were \xe2\x80\x94 waiting to get inside.     He refinanced his mortgage, choosing a low payment option that added to his loan balance each month rather than subtracted. Then the real estate market crashed in Las Vegas, and he became underwater on his mortgage. He could continue to pay but owing more on the mortgage than the house was worth, keeping the house was hurting his finances. Carl wrestled with what he perceived to be a moral obligation to continue paying his mortgage and the moral obligation to take care of his family.     After discussing the issue with other, Carl decided that what he had was not a moral obligation with the bank but a contractual obligation, and he should look at the mortgage as a business arrangement. Any business would reevaluate their financial situation, and if it was a better decision to stop paying the mortgage in order to qualify for a short sale, despite the credit score hit, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he should do.     While this was the logical, mathematical choice, it only became a possibility when Carl felt better about breaking his mortgage agreement.  Human behavior plays a larger role than mathematics, even in this case.  Again, from the article:     The process of making financial decisions is about more than building a spreadsheet to calculate the answer, because life rarely fits cleanly into a spreadsheet. Our decisions often appear irrational until we understand the whole story.      Would you walk away from your house and your mortgage  if you owed more than the house was worth, your loan balance was increasing each month, and you\xe2\x80\x99d be better off financially if you just stopped?

One of the big deals of this new initiative is the removal of the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) cap on eligible fixed-rate mortgages. Now, mortgages that qualify for refinancing under the HARP have loan-to-value ratios of 80% to, well, as high as you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten yourself into.    It surprised me a little that 125% LTV wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, but after doing some math, I can see how LTV of 200% or more are not out of the question.\xc2\xa0 In Miami, for example, inflation-adjusted home prices  dropped 50%  from 2007 to the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 If someone took out a  fixed-rate mortgage  for most of the purchase price, then the loan-to-value would be in the neighborhood of 175% today if the borrower made regular payments against the mortgage.    Unlike the first- and long-time homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s  tax credit , this initiative is almost completely for homeowners in over their heads.\xc2\xa0 The  minimum  LTV ratio is 80%.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not underwater but it\xe2\x80\x99s still fairly high leverage.\xc2\xa0 The expanded HARP blanket is also targeted at people who are still making their payments; to qualify, there must have been no late payments in the past six months, and no more than one during the past year.     Is this HARP initiative throwing good money after bad?     This all makes for good press but guaranteeing loans this far underwater at attractive fixed rates isn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of move the finance industry would make on its own.\xc2\xa0 Under normal circumstances, lenders like (a) to be paid back, and like (b) to get interest that\xe2\x80\x99s commensurate with the risk they\xe2\x80\x99re taking with lending the money.\xc2\xa0 Take away the risk of being paid back, and strange things happen, like really low interest rates for highly-undercollateralized loans.    That\xe2\x80\x99s the lender\xe2\x80\x99s side.\xc2\xa0 But what about the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s side?\xc2\xa0 Is it throwing good money after bad to take \xe2\x80\x9cThe Enterprises\xe2\x80\x9d up on this offer?\xc2\xa0 If the refinance actually does make things more affordable, yes.\xc2\xa0 Pay the sucker down faster now that the payment\xe2\x80\x99s lower, or build up an emergency fund.\xc2\xa0 Take advantage of it.\xc2\xa0 The subsidy is there.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be there forever.

This week brought the 115th confirmed case of polio, a crippling and at times fatal disease passed on virally, mainly through bad hygiene. The tally is well up on last year.In most countries polio is barely a memory. Rich countries had largely eliminated it by the 1970s, and many poor countries soon followed suit. Three decades ago the world saw an estimated 400,000 polio cases a year. Thanks to a cheap and effective vaccine, administered by two drops into a child\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and washed down with dollops of public and private money, the annual global number is now roughly 1,000.Only in South Asia and Nigeria is it still endemic, though it occasionally flares elsewhere. Since even wretched countries such as Sudan and Myanmar are rid of polio, doctors dream it could follow smallpox and rinderpest to become the third disease wiped from the planet. For hope, look at India. Last year it had just 44 cases of polio, down from an estimated 250,000 three decades ago. Sarah Crowe, of UNICEF in...    \r\n')

The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, asserts in its report that: "The Prime Minister insisted that leaving the EU was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in our national    interest\xe2\x80\x9d but said he felt \xe2\x80\x9cvery personally\xe2\x80\x9d that now was the time for a    fundamental reconsideration of European relations".Actually, Mr Cameron\'s speech was more subtle than that, and more pragmatic than his House of Commons intervention last month.

Plenty of academic researchers think so. The researchers say that many investors pick poor-performing actively managed funds. Instead of trying to beat the benchmarks with actively managed funds, most investors would do better by sticking with index funds, the academics argue.           But a new study by Morningstar suggests that investors aren\'t so dumb after all. According to the latest data, typical investors have achieved competitive results. "Investors have done a good job of picking active funds," says John Rekenthaler, Morningstar\'s vice president of research.           \tRekenthaler says that the typical academic study looks at a group of 200 or so actively managed funds. Most often two-thirds or more of the funds failed to outdo their benchmarks during the previous 10 years. While the data in the studies may be accurate, the results don\'t necessarily reflect the experience of the typical investor, says Rekenthaler.         ...

The details are not yet public, but this sounds important. It follows various regional experiments with emissions-trading and a resources tax (which affects petroleum but not ...   \r\n')

0.26604487087718914, '      I\xe2\x80\x99ve avoided writing about Black Friday this year. In the community I follow, promoting the day after Thanksgiving for shopping has gotten completely out of hand. I wrote an article for PC World a few years ago,  The Insider\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Black Friday Bargains , where the tips are still relevant for today\xe2\x80\x99s shoppers. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to write a new article every year about how to find the best Black Friday deals.    As if Black Friday weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough of a marketing scheme, a few years ago consumers were blessed to receive Cyber Monday, yet another day of hype encouraging people to buy more. I\xe2\x80\x99m not always anti-consumerism, but I just find every year\xe2\x80\x99s increased holiday sale hype, designed as a last-ditch, end-of-year effort to make up for poor sales since January 1, annoying. Doorbusters, bait-and-switch, and worst of all, and  crazed Wal-Mart shoppers who are willing to kill others  just to be first to grab some sale item that will be worth a tiny portion of its sale price in five months, make me embarrassed to be an American consumer.     The opposite approach is to put faith in  Buy Nothing Day . The message of Buy Nothing Day is good, but like any temporary boycott, it just time-shifts spending; what you don\xe2\x80\x99t spend on the day after Thanksgiving you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely spend the next day. And if a sale expires, you\xe2\x80\x99ll spend more.    The worst thing to come out of the holiday hype is \xe2\x80\x9cSmall Business Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d (Let\xe2\x80\x99s just stop naming the days following Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Thursday.) This is American Express\xe2\x80\x99s effort to get consumers to patronize local stores in favor of national chains. On the surface, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad idea. Support business owners in the community by visiting smaller retail establishments who otherwise have a difficult time competing with large box stores like Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target, and Home Depot. Your neighborhood appliance or hardware store generally charge more money for the same products offered by national chains because small stores have little leverage to negotiate with wholesalers. Working with a small business based in the community you live, having a friendly face who can help answer your questions, and building a relationship with a business owner might be strong enough reasons to settle for a higher priced item.    This is coming from American Express. Many small business owners simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to accept payments using American Express cards. It costs more money for a retailer to accept most American Express cards than most Visa or MasterCard credit cards. When you do use your American Express cards at a small business, you are not helping the store as much as you would if you were to pay with cash. American Express interchange fees can take an unhealthy bite out of a small business\xe2\x80\x99s profits. Also, unlike Visa and MasterCard, who generally split merchant fees with banks that issue their cards, American Express cards are generally not issued by third parties, and the company keeps the entire interchange fee.    The \xe2\x80\x9cSmall Business Saturday\xe2\x80\x9d campaign was not created for the good of the overall economy. American Express offers this message, \xe2\x80\x9cThe 2nd annual Small Business Saturday\xc2\xae is a day dedicated to supporting small businesses on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d but the day supports American Express, which is not a small business. Through this campaign, American Express is offering small businesses that accept their cards to prominently display an advertisement that offers a $25 credit to any customer who uses an American Express card to purchase items totaling $25 or more at the location. There is little in this campaign other than self-interest and self-promotion on American Express\xe2\x80\x99s part.    Is this bad? It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. If you want to do your part to support local businesses that are in danger of closing partly due to the high prices credit card companies charge, shop there but pay cash. Forget about the 1% cash back or less you can earn, paid for by the small business owners. The $25 credit in the offer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support small businesses because this isn\xe2\x80\x99t extra money that can be used to purchase more in a store. It\xe2\x80\x99s a statement credit, designed to thank card holders for using American Express and requiring retailers that accept the cards to pay more to AmEx through fees.    American Express is, thanks to capitalism, allowed to promote almost anything it likes in order to increase profit.

(MainStreet) -- Once upon a time in travel, a great spa required little more than a few treatment rooms and moody music to lure those in search of rejuvenation. These days, however, a new brand of uber-spas define the ultimate holistic getaway for those that spare no expense when it comes to traveling to the remote edges of Earth seeking enlightenment with a good dose of glitz.           For those in search of a "save my soul" ashram experience without having to sleep in linens of less than 1,000 thread count, India\'s luxurious Shreyas Retreat in Bangalore admits 25 guests at a time to explore the spiritual dimensions of yoga, sacred Indian texts and meditation. Visitors arrive in a tropical resort setting of Asian architecture surrounding a main guest compound with a pool and outdoor pavilion. Wide lawns become the setting for late-night bonfires, and there is a selection of poolside tented cottages (minimally decorated with few lux distractions for soul searchers). There is exclusively vegetarian cuisine formulated individually for each guest.                            The Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, on an island in the middle of Lake Pichola amid a backdrop of the Aravalli Mountains, has 66 rooms ready for the luxury traveler.                      Most guests come from the U.S. and U.K. seeking enlightenment through a series of sunrise and sunset instructions interspersed with guided and lengthy meditations from lifetime practitioners. Its spa offers natural scrubs using flowers and herbs grown on the compound in addition to the not-so-spiritual pedicure or manicure for those who like to keep up their "outer shell."        ...                                                    \r\n')

Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s celebration will be particularly festive.    As American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO)  announced  last week, the company named Hanson as its new Chief Executive Officer and a director, starting January 30, 2012. Hanson, who capped a 23-year career with Levi\xe2\x80\x99s by serving as its Global President,\xc2\xa0was chosen to succeed retiring American Eagle CEO, Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, who \xc2\xa0has been in the top job since December, 2002.    The company filed Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s new 3-year\xc2\xa0 employment agreement \xc2\xa0as an attachment to this  8-K , which arrived as part of last week\xe2\x80\x99s official \xe2\x80\x9cFriday Night Dump.\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x93 as employment agreements go \xe2\x80\x93 this one is no turkey.    For starters, Hanson gets a signing bonus of $3.339 million, to be paid sometime between January 1 and January 13, 2012. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start when he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to, or if he leaves within a year or is terminated for cause, he might have to repay the money.    The \xe2\x80\x9cside dish\xe2\x80\x9d terms Hanson got are pretty tasty, too. His base salary will start at $1.03 million, and Hanson agreed that any money exceeding $1 million will be deposited into his\xc2\xa0Deferred Compensation Plan each year. (That money will vest in thirds over the next three anniversaries of Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s start date.)    American Eagle Outfitters also promised to give Hanson \xe2\x80\x93 for FY 2012 only \xe2\x80\x93 a\xc2\xa0long term equity incentive compensation award worth $3.2 million. In addition, it\xe2\x80\x99s giving him a restricted stock unit award worth $2.5 million and a stock option grant for common stock with a grant date value equal to another $2.5 million. Both the number of the RSUs and the exercise price for the options will be tied to the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock price on the day that Hanson reports for work. That\xe2\x80\x99s an extra $8.2 million, and \xe2\x80\x93 like many a Thanksgiving dinner \xe2\x80\x93 we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten to the dessert terms yet.    Also, for FY 2012, his maximum incentive cash bonus will be 130% of his base salary. However, starting in  FY 2013  \xe2\x80\x9cthe target incentive bonus shall be 130% of his base salary and the maximum incentive bonus shall be 260% of his base salary.\xe2\x80\x9d (Lucky Hanson: Here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing for him to be grateful for! We noticed that the 8-K\xe2\x80\x99s summary differs slightly and states: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6beginning with the  2014 fiscal year , the target incentive bonus shall be 130% of his base salary and the maximum bonus shall be 260% of his base salary\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d  [Emphasis added to highlight the year.]  It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter which document is \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d since the\xc2\xa0signed contract trumps the summary any day of the week. Those are the terms that a court would enforce.)    Hanson will also get up to $15,000 in legal fees, \xe2\x80\x9ca single luxury automobile for both business and personal use\xe2\x80\x9d (alas, it\xe2\x80\x99s not giving him a tax gross-up on the car), and a relocation package so that he can move to a home \xe2\x80\x9cin reasonable proximity\xe2\x80\x9d to either the company\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or its New York, New York offices within 6 months of taking the job. The house-hunting clause come with a little extra whipped cream that entitles Hanson to take his time and find just the right home. It allows him:       \xe2\x80\x9ci) travel expenses for up to six (6) house hunting trips for Executive and a companion and (ii) household goods moving expenses, relocation allowances, temporary living expenses, and other relocation costs or expenses to which the parties agree\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d       And finally, the parties also signed a  Change in Control Agreement  that promises Hanson severance (2x his annual compensation), a pro-rated bonus, 18 months\xe2\x80\x99 of benefits under COBRA, and accelerated vesting of his equity interests if a change in control occurs.    With a new deal worth more than $12.6 million (plus whatever bonus he gets, and whatever the relocation ends up costing), Hanson will be a busy guy tomorrow when he counts his blessings\xe2\x80\xa6 or at least his new compensation package.

For investors, the hopeful journey started in the 1980s as inflation came under control around the world. Yields came down, prices went up, a simple \xe2\x80\x9cbuy and hold\xe2\x80\x9d strategy could often provide decent returns. Even boring old Treasury bonds returned 9.1% annually between 1982 and 2007, according to a Deutsche Bank study of long-term returns.At the end of such a journey, though, yields must reach a point where they can fall little if any further. And that explains much of the sorry pass at which investors have now arrived. Almost every asset class seems to be fraught with danger. Equities have suffered two bear markets in just over a decade and remain vulnerable to a rich-world recession; government bonds offer little protection against a resurgence of inflation; commodities are volatile and hostage to a possible drop in Chinese demand; property is still suffering from indigestion after the past decade\xe2\x80\x99s boom.   ...     \r\n')

Thanks to profits in the banking industry from a variety of sources, banks could justify offering checking account services, including debit cards, without charging any fees. The industry has changed over the past year, and many banks, particularly large financial institutions, are finding ways to earn more money from depositors.    Only a few banks remain that offer competitive interest rates \xe2\x80\x94 and in today\xe2\x80\x99s environment these rates are nothing exciting \xe2\x80\x94 without charging oversized fees. For a limited time, EverBank is attracting new customers with a $60 cash bonus after opening a  Yield Pledge Checking Account .       The amount of $60 has become a special number recently. Bank of America\xe2\x80\x99s new debit card fee is $5 per month, or $60 annually. EverBank has devised the clever idea that turning the $60 from a fee to a benefit might be a good way to attract customers. Whether you consider it a gimmick or not, free money can help anyone.     EverBank has some requirements for new customers wishing to earn the $60 cash bonus. The bank doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give $60 to every new customer. Those seeking the bonus will need to be aware of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s conditions for qualification.       The  Yield Pledge Checking Account  must be opened by  November 30, 2011  with an initial deposit of at least $1,500.    New customers must establish a repeating direct deposit of at least $500 before January 31, 2012.    Accounts must have an average daily balance of $1,500 for statement periods ending December 31, 2011 and January 31, 2012.    The account must remain open until February 29, 2012.       For any new customer who meets the above conditions, EverBank will deposit the $60 cash bonus into the account on or before February 29, 2012. Furthermore, if you use your Yield Pledge Checking Account and are not satisfied after three months and one successful bill payment, EverBank will give you $50.    As an added bonus unrelated to the special promotional offer, EverBank will reimburse users for all ATM fees, regardless of whether the ATM is included within the EverBank network. There is no maximum to this reimbursement as long as EverBank believes the reimbursement requests are legitimate.    EverBank Yield Pledge Checking Account Rates             \t   \t\t  Account Balance   Interest Rate (APY)   \t         \t   \t\t  $100,000 - $10,000,000   0.76%   \t   \t   \t\t  $50,000 - $99,999   0.71%   \t   \t   \t\t  $25,000 - $49,999   0.61%   \t   \t   \t\t  $10,000 - $24,999   0.56%   \t   \t   \t\t  $9,999 or less   0.46%   \t              EverBank is not as well-known as many other banks because they don\xe2\x80\x99t advertise often. The bank has over $12 billion in assets, so even if the bank is not popular, it is sizable. There is no monthly account maintenance fee for the Yield Pledge Checking Account. If the latest offer interests you, sign up for an  EverBank checking account  and earn the $60 cash bonus before the offer expires on November 30, 2011.

The bad news on this front is that Hungary, Peru and Romania have attracted the USTR\xe2\x80\x99s attention for their protectionist policies in telephone services, fuel and products previously controlled by state monopolies. On the good side, Norway has reformed its monopsonistic system of buying pharmaceuticals for hospitals. Another negative is in the growing field of electronic commerce; the USTR finds that 52 countries now hamper trade on the Internet, up from 46 last year.

Human capital has a number of definitions, but in this case, it refers to a measurement of who you are, particularly in relation to how you might be seen as valuable to an employer or a client. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only way to define a person, but since it ties directly into your future earnings and your potential net worth, it is related to finance and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be ignored. It\xe2\x80\x99s as important, or even more important, than your net worth measurement.     Consider two job applicants with identical technical skills and education, both pertaining to the job description, and a similar personality that could result in either choice being a good fit for the company. One of the applicants has indicated that he has often been called upon to present information about hie field to the public. Having presentation skills can make a prospective employee more attractive to the employer. The ability to eloquently, entertainingly, and comfortably lead a discussion or present information in front of an audience can open opportunities.    Anyone can throw together a Powerpoint presentation together, but delivering that presentation isn\xe2\x80\x99t as easy as reading the bullet points. Anyone can write a speech, but elocution is a skill that requires careful honing.     Most people in \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d head directly to Toastmasters. Toastmasters uses a standardized curriculum and a safe practice environment that allows people to receive the education and experience they need to take their presenting skills to the next level. My former company, at the satellite location where I worked, had an internal Toastmasters group. We met once every two weeks to critique each other\xe2\x80\x99s speeches or presentations and gain experience speaking extemporaneously about random topics assigned in the moment.    Outside of Toastmasters, you can gain experience speaking and presenting by organizing an event in your community. Libraries offer these opportunities as do community centers and religious organizations. If your field of interest holds conferences, try to get on the schedule of speakers.     Public speaking is acting and performing    Stage fright is a common barrier to increasing public speaking experience. There are two keys to overcoming stage fright or performance anxiety: being overly prepared and breathing properly. Even though the solution is simple, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy. Even veteran actors deal with stage fright, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that is easily cured even it can be managed. Acting experience can be beneficial for public speaking, as many of the skills are similar. In addition to acting, any kind of performance experience \xe2\x80\x94 music, dance, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 can have positive effects on confidence and the ability to successfully deliver a speech.    Acting also helps develop a performer\xe2\x80\x99s presence. If you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking publicly, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to have a presence that\xe2\x80\x99s informative and trusted. The best speakers are sometimes described as \xe2\x80\x9clarger than life.\xe2\x80\x9d You know when they walk into a room that whatever they have to say will be worth hearing.    Actors develop emotional communication skills. Without saying a word, an actor can convey an emotion. The audience will be able to understand what the actor is thinking or feeling. Skilled actors can transmit those emotions to the audience, so the spectators can sympathetically feel what the actor is feeling. This is an invaluable skill for speakers. It could mean the difference between a good presentation and a speech that has the audience on the edge of their seats.     How do you suggest gaining public speaking experience?

(MHS) and Express Scripts, Inc. (ESRX) announced their intentions this past June to combine forces in a  $29.1 billion merger , the top dogs at both companies have been busy  lobbying\xc2\xa0Congress  and officials at a host of federal agencies to convince them that the deal  won\xe2\x80\x99t \xc2\xa0violate antitrust laws and that it\xc2\xa0 will \xc2\xa0be good for consumers. But the\xc2\xa0 merger proxy \xc2\xa0that Medco filed on Friday convinced us of a different point: Its named executive officers will get multi-million-dollar payouts if the merger goes through and they subsequently lose their jobs.    The disclosures come in the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Parachute Compensation\xe2\x80\x9d section of the filing, on page 182, just in case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it that far. The numbers used are just an estimate, based on the hypothetical scenario that the merger had been approved, and that Medco\xe2\x80\x99s named executive officers had been terminated on October 31, 2011.    Medco\xe2\x80\x99s Chairman and CEO, David B. Snow, Jr., stands to gain more than $38.96 million if he is terminated within a year after the merger closes. Of that sum, $12.6 million would be paid as cash severance and more than $26.34 million for Snow\xe2\x80\x99s equity interests.    Other top executives would also get nice payouts: President and Chief Operating Officer, Kenneth O. Klepper stands to get more than $15. 7 million;\xc2\xa0Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO, Richard J. Rubino, could receive nearly $10.33 million;\xc2\xa0General Counsel, Secretary and President, Global Pharmaceutical Strategies,\xc2\xa0Thomas M. Moriarty, could get more than $9.76 million; and Group President, Employer/Key Accounts,\xc2\xa0Timothy C. Wentworth, may receive more than $9.12 million.    But whereas Snow\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to the money (per his employment agreement) is conditioned upon the merger closing and him being terminated within a year, the other four executives\xe2\x80\x99 rights come from the Change in Control Severance Plan; thus, they are protected if a qualifying termination occurs within  two years  following the Medco merger.    These numbers could \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially differ\xe2\x80\x9d from amounts that may actually be paid, but \xe2\x80\x93 based on the explanation in the merger proxy \xe2\x80\x93 it seems far more likely that the payout numbers would go up, not down:       \xe2\x80\x9cThe amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and do not reflect certain compensation actions occurring before completion of the\xc2\xa0Medco merger (such as the grant of stock options and RSUs in respect of 2011 performance and payment of 2011 bonuses)\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d       Express Scripts and Medco are independently holding special shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meetings at the same time on December 21, and it remains to be seen whether their shareholders will approve the deal. The filing also disclosed that both companies are currently working on their responses to the Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material. After that, the DOJ, the FTC,\xc2\xa0state attorneys general, and possibly others could file suit to block or restrict the merger. But it seems clear that Medco\xe2\x80\x99s top executives don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about missing their mortgage payments if the merger goes through and they subsequently find themselves out of work.    Meanwhile, Medco employees continue to have questions about the deal, judging by  this 8-K  that the company filed late Friday. One of the first questions had to do with which executives plan to stick around post-deal. We thought the answer, which of course relates to the pay-outs, was worth including here:     \xe2\x80\x9cThe complete and extended leadership team for the new organization is still under review and has not been decided. Medco\xe2\x80\x99s senior executives remain committed to ensuring the merger is completed and that the transition positions the new entity for its continuing success.\xe2\x80\x9d     Suffice it to say that that sounds like a lot of fancy words to not really answer the question on whether the executives are staying or leaving.

Economists polled by MarketWatch expect a final November reading of 65, compared with a preliminary estimate of 64.2, with consumers somewhat cheered by lower gas prices, but concerned about stock volatility. In October sentiment reached 60.9. The sentiment gauge, which covers how consumers view their personal finances as well as business and buying conditions, averaged about 87 in the year before the start of the most recent recession. Economists watch sentiment data to get a feel for the direction of consumer spending.

In this security breach, those affected might have received a statement with a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s account number, transaction detail, and in some cases, Social Security number. Other affected customers might have had their information compromised, with their details included on other customers\xe2\x80\x99 statements, without their knowledge.    Wells Fargo through its spokesman Josh Dunn blamed the error on a \xe2\x80\x9cmalfunctioning printer.\xe2\x80\x9d     The biggest threat is that with an account name and number, and a bank\xe2\x80\x99s routing number which is public information, anyone can easily print a check. When presented, if the signature isn\xe2\x80\x99t checked, could result in a withdrawal from the compromised customer\xe2\x80\x99s account. For those whose Social Security numbers have been shared, the potential fraud could be worse.     My first reaction is to encourage customers to turn off paper statements opting instead for online statements only, but that won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent every potential bank error. Online statements are much more secure than mailed statements.    If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been affected, I would suggest changing your account number at Wells Fargo. This may be a significant process, particularly if you have direct deposit enabled or automated debits scheduled with outside vendors. It will be worth the effort, however, to ensure the compromised account number is no longer linked to you. If you Social Security number has been shared with a stranger, you should contact one of the credit reporting bureaus to freeze your credit. Your Social Security number can be used to open accounts in your name, using your credit history, so by working with the credit agencies you can opt to be notified if anyone tries to open a new line of credit.     Considering Wells Fargo\xe2\x80\x99s error, the bank should offer to pay for credit monitoring services for affected customers.     Is this extra motivation for moving your money out of a big bank?  There are many reasons to  switch to a credit union , but this may not be a reason on its own. Mistakes like this one can happen at any institution, regardless of the company\xe2\x80\x99s size.     I\xe2\x80\x99ve used Wells Fargo for my primary banking services, ever since Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia, since Wachovia acquired First Union, since First Union acquired CoreStates, since Philadelphia National Bank merged with New Jersey National Bank forming CoreStates Financial Corporation.

Success appeared to come almost effortlessly to her, even though her origins were humble. She was born to a Kikuyu family of peasant farmers in Ihithe, a small village in the central highlands of Kenya, which was then a British colony.

Please consider  Government Doubles Bank Guarantees     State guarantees to Greek commercial banks are to double from 30 billion to 60 billion euros in order to secure liquidity in the market, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told lawmakers in Athens on Monday.      Addressing Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s Financial Affairs Committee, Venizelos said that ensuring the market\xe2\x80\x99s cash flow continues will secure the liquidity of the banking system and safeguard bank deposits.      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Greek banking system is guaranteed with indefinite liquidity and there is no issue with the stability of the system. This is the case for all eurozone countries,\xe2\x80\x9d Venizelos said.

Previously a great method for buying items that may have been on the expensive side in eras when credit was not available to many consumers, the same economic conditions returned when credit card offers became scarce recently. Layaway programs are popular around the holidays, because consumers who plan in advance can reserve popular gifts (like the  year\xe2\x80\x99s hottest toys ) while saving for the complete purchase, regardless of whether a  credit card  is available.    Taking Walmart\xe2\x80\x99s layaway program as an example, we can draw a comparison between shopping with a layaway program, using a credit card, and paying with cash. Assume you use Walmart\xe2\x80\x99s full layaway period, October 17 through December 16, you make payments for two months before receiving your item, and you pay a $5 up-front fee for the privilege. Assume also you are buying items that cost $250 in total. The $5 fee over two months equates roughly to a 12% annual percentage rate. That\xe2\x80\x99s not that much different from credit card rates, possibly a little lower than average.    With a credit card, however, you can take the purchased item home immediately. With layaway, the store holds the product for you until you\xe2\x80\x99ve completed your payments. If you decide later on not to finish purchasing an item on layaway, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to pay another fee in order to get your initial deposit of 10% of the item price and any subsequent payments back.    Without a layaway program or a credit card, you would need to save on your own before having enough cash to buy your items. If it takes two months to save up, you would receive the item at the same time you would have if you had taken advantage of layaway, but without the item reserved for you, it might be sold out by the time you can afford to buy it. That\xe2\x80\x99s reason enough to avoid some of the most popular holiday gifts. The best option is to save for your holiday spending \xe2\x80\x94 or spending for any large item for which a layaway program would be beneficial \xe2\x80\x94 well enough in advance of needing to complete the purchase.    There are several benefits of taking advantage of a layaway program for holiday shopping.       Reserve your item in advance, ensuring the popular item will be available later.    Avoid traditional banks and credit cards, and likely pay smaller fees.    Keep your savings in your bank account.       Layaway programs provide an alternative to saving in advance, with a fee to pay for the privilege. In some cases, it can be a better deal than paying with a credit card, though consumers making credit card payments have the advantage of taking the purchased item home immediately.     Besides these benefits, there are potential drawbacks and dangers. One important drawback of layaway programs is that you lock in the price when you place your downpayment. If the store offers a sale later on, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to take advantage of the lower price without cancelling your layaway and incurring fees to do so. If the item you wish to buy is offered at a deep discount, you may be willing to incur the cancellation fee, but otherwise the result is paying more to take home an item than shoppers who bought the item that day without the help of layaway.    Be aware of your store\xe2\x80\x99s policies. While the cancellation of a layaway program usually won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent a full refund (minus fees), some stores take a stronger stance and offer no refunds.    There is a lot of pressure to buy gifts during the holiday season in an effort not to disappoint loved ones. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to manage expectations \xe2\x80\x94 or it can be, if a family has a philosophy of managing expectations already \xe2\x80\x94 than to jump through financial hoops to buy the latest and greatest trendy gifts.

In contrast to his wealth of experience (Mr Ma has also been mayor of Taipei, the capital), his chief opponent, Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is a rather owlish academic who has never before been elected to public office.Now things are not looking nearly as certain.

Butler, effective November 8. While the suddenness seemed a bit unusual to us, ADP  cast this  as part of a \xe2\x80\x9csuccession plan previously established,\xe2\x80\x9d so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really question the timing. Today, we learned that he had been arrested on a criminal domestic-violence charge in the days before Butler stepped down.    We got the tip from a reader, who pointed us to a facsimile  booking report  posted on the website of the  Beaufort Tribune , a local newspaper in Beaufort County, South Carolina. We put in calls to ADP ( no response yet    see below  ), to the numbers we could find for Butler (also no response yet), and to the Beaufort County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, which confirmed that the Butler who was arrested also worked for ADP. (The picture on the booking report certainly suggested as much, compared to  publicity shots \xc2\xa0of the ADP executive, but we like to make sure.)      Update:   \xc2\xa0An ADP spokesman called back last night while I was flying back from Chicago, and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to connect until this morning. This is the statement the company just sent a few minutes ago:       \xe2\x80\x9cOn November 8, 2011, Gary Butler informed the ADP Board of Directors of his decision to retire from the Company and resign from the Board for personal reasons. The Board was aware of the circumstances surrounding his decision and immediately implemented its previously established succession plan, under which Carlos Rodriguez would become CEO upon Mr. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s retirement. Out of respect for his privacy, ADP is not commenting further.\xe2\x80\x9d      Butler was arrested on November 6 at what appears to be a  second home  in Bluffton, South Carolina. (ADP is based in New Jersey, and we understand Butler listed a Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, address with police in South Carolina). We were told by the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office that Butler and his wife had argued earlier in the day, and then went out to dinner with friends. That night, after returning home, the argument resumed, according to the police report on file with the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office. \xe2\x80\x9cAt some point Mr Butler grabbed [his wife] by the neck and by the wrist and pushed her against a bureau in the bedroom, and she fled the residence and called law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d Beaufort County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office Sgt. Robin McIntosh told us, citing the police report. She said Butler\xe2\x80\x99s wife didn\xe2\x80\x99t need medical attention, but that officers found signs \xe2\x80\x9cof somebody having had their hands on her.\xe2\x80\x9d    The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any record of prior incidents involving Butler. A hearing in  General Sessions Court  is scheduled for December 16.    The incident may explain the sudden series of events that led up to Butler\xe2\x80\x99s departure. His resignation came on November 8, the day after he was booked; his resignation was announced the next day \xe2\x80\x94  cast as a retirement  \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa0and his  separation agreement  was dated November 14 (but retroactive to November 8).    We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if we learn more, or hear back from Butler or ADP.

Indeed, back in March, shortly after the $12.2 billion deal with CenturyLink (CTL) was announced, we bid a  bittersweet adieu , after years of poking at Qwest both on the site and in my book,  Financial Fine Print .    And then CenturyLink has to go and ruin it by filing  this 10-Q  earlier this week. There on page 12, under the section \xe2\x80\x9cAcquisition of Qwest\xe2\x80\x9d was this tasty pearl:       We retrospectively adjusted our previously reported preliminary assignment of the aggregate Qwest consideration for changes to our original estimates of the fair value of certain items at the acquisition date. Identifiable intangible assets\xe2\x80\x94other decreased $179\xc2\xa0million due to a decreased tradename valuation and accounts receivable and other current assets increased by $88\xc2\xa0million primarily due to a change in deferred income taxes and an insurance reimbursement related to a litigation settlement. Deferred credits and other liabilities increased by $40\xc2\xa0million primarily from a change in deferred income taxes and a revision to our pension and post retirement asset valuation. Goodwill increased by $130\xc2\xa0million as an offset to the above mentioned changes.       Making these sorts of adjustments post-acquisition isn\xe2\x80\x99t really all that unusual. After all, it usually takes a few months to really get your hands around a situation post-acquisition. Still, adding $130 million in goodwill seems like more than a rounding error to us.    Indeed, if you poke around the filing a bit more, you see that CenturyTel\xe2\x80\x99s goodwill on its balance sheet has blossomed from $8.7 billion at the end of last year to a whopping $19.2 billion, most of that directly tied to the acquisition of Qwest.    We\xe2\x80\x99re sure hoping that this really is our last post on Qwest.

Bloomberg reports  IMF Revamps Credit Lines to Lure Nations     The Washington-based IMF today said the new instrument, the Precautionary and Liquidity Line, can be tapped by countries with strong economies currently facing short-term liquidity needs. Countries with potential needs can also apply, as they did in the past under the Precautionary Credit Line that the new instrument replaces.      \xe2\x80\x9cThe reform enhances the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide financing for crisis prevention and resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in an e-mailed statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is another step toward creating an effective global financial safety net to deal with increased global interconnectedness.\xe2\x80\x9d      The changes, which enable countries that pre-qualify to request IMF funds without having to make as many policy changes as with traditional loans, come as Europe\xe2\x80\x99s crisis threatens to spread to Spain and France. The IMF is co-financing bailouts in Greece, Portugal and Ireland and is preparing to send a team to Italy for an unprecedented audit of the country\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to cut its debt.      The Standard and Poor\xe2\x80\x99s 500 Index pared losses after the report.   Not Big News       Via email, Bank of America / Merrill Lynch says "This is Not Big News"        The IMF has announced some easier access to their limited supply of funds (as below). Despite the eye catching headlines, BofAML do not think that this is particularly new news, nor that financially impactful, unfortunately except possibly for smaller countries and even that is unclear.       Thanos (ex-IMF): Thinks the IMF\'s PLL is in no way a game changer by itself. The PLL could be used in east Europe. It could also be used in Italy and Spain, but more for its conditionality than for its limited firepower compared to funding needs.  And in any case, an SBA or even an EFF would be better for Italy and Spain, as such arrangements have more conditions linked to reforms.       Laurence Boone (Head of Euro Econ): Thinks this does not necessarily mean more money. It means easier access to IMF money. In 2008/09 euro national central banks lent about $75bn to the IMF, a repeat of this lending is something they may or may not be able to repeat this time.       Ardash (BofAML APAC): Points out the PLL was flagged during the G20 summit and mentioned in its communique - officials have already suggested it would be more appropriate for financing needs of smaller countries, rather than the big fish (Italy and Spain).. even 10x quota is simply not enough, let alone judging whether they are committed to "sound policies".        Expect Continued Bull Market in Meaningless Headlines       Note the market continues to move on meaningless headlines. Also note the duration of each move higher keeps getting shorter. That means we can expect a huge bull market in meaningless headlines as EU officials, Eurozone officials, and the IMF keep searching for things to say to placate the markets.       "Lure" the Perfect Word       By the way, Bloomberg\'s headline title is near-perfect. The phrase "lure nations" is appropriate. "To their economic death" needs to be added.      This is what I think of the IMF as noted in  To Ireland With Love .               IMF\'s Trojan Horse Gift to Ireland      I believe we have all heard the story and know how it ends.

Pittman had been a muckety at the company formerly known as AOL Time Warner, and his new employer promised (among other perks) to \xe2\x80\x9cmake an aircraft (which, to the extent available, will be a Dassault-Breguet Mystere Falcon 900) available to Mr. Pittman for his business and personal use,\xe2\x80\x9d at company expense.    Well, Clear Channel filed another  8-K  just after 4:30 p.m. Friday (toward the early end of the weekly Friday night dump) that suggests the deal is even sweeter than it first seemed. It looks like Pittman isn\xe2\x80\x99t just getting free jet rides \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s getting paid $3 million for the privilege of riding around in  his own \xc2\xa0fancy jet.    See, it turns out that Pittman, as busy as he undoubtedly is, has enough time to run an aircraft leasing operation. A major customer (perhaps its only customer?) is Clear Channel Broadcasting, a wholly owned unit of Clear Channel Media Holdings. Given the terms laid out in the filing, of course, this aircraft-leasing business doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem too demanding: Clear Channel has agreed to pay $3 million up front, will \xe2\x80\x9cobtain insurance policies covering all operations of the Aircraft at CCB\xe2\x80\x99s sole cost and expense,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0and on top of that, is taking on       \xe2\x80\x9call taxes or fees which may be assessed or levied as a result of the leasing or operation of the Aircraft \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0CCB will be responsible for all costs of operating and maintaining the Aircraft during the Term (as defined below), other than discretionary upgrades, capital improvements or refurbishment. \xc2\xa0CCMH intends to make the Aircraft available to Mr. Pittman for his business and personal use pursuant to the terms of his previously disclosed employment agreement with CCMH.\xe2\x80\x9d       And there you go: The company promised to let him tool around in a corporate jet for both business and personal travel. And it will be his  own \xc2\xa0fancy jet. And the company will pay him $3 million to lease the jet from him. So that he can fly around in it. (Got that?)    Clearly Pittman has an eye for irony, in addition to fine corporate aircraft and convoluted related-party transactions, because he dubbed his leasing company Yet Again Inc. We\xe2\x80\x99re all for serial entrepreneurship, and we like cute names as much as the next person. But at a certain point, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just rubbing it in?    In a generous gesture, incidentally, Pittman has graciously agreed to return some of that $3 million if the arrangement should be canceled before its six-year term expires.    You can see the  FAA record  of Pittman\xe2\x80\x99s plane, and more (including a photo of the jet itself) from  www.airport-data.com . Of course, the WSJ Jet Tracker lists  where it\xe2\x80\x99s been , and how often, from 2007 through last year \xe2\x80\x94 we see nearly two-dozen trips to Telluride, and of course a bunch of pleasant, stylish and/or sunny locales, including Paris (seven times), Montego Bay in Jamaica (21 times), Las Vegas (13 times), and even a lone trip to the  Netherlands Antilles \xc2\xa0(from Jamaica, in fact).    We should also note that, after we spotted the filing on Friday, we discovered that a couple of folks had also noticed the document. A tip of the hat to  Radio-Info.com , which credited the TRI newsletter in a post yesterday.    When Pittman talked to  DealBook  last month, he observed that he had been able to take the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s job for a while before accepting the CEO position, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of those companies where the closer you looked, the better it seemed.\xe2\x80\x9d    From his perspective, anyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s no arguing that point.

It\xe2\x80\x99s an imagining of how a guest of the future might interact with his hotel during an overnight stay. Specifically it looks at how a modern hotel might utilise social media to improve the service it offers customers.For example:7 AM PST: You hop on a flight from LA to New York. Before take-off, you tweet, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaded to NYC. Looking 4ward to drink poolside @ThompsonLES.\xe2\x80\x9d When you land and turn your mobile on, you have a Twitter response from @ThompsonLES, which reads, \xe2\x80\x9cWe look forward to having you. Shall we reserve you a lounge chair?\xe2\x80\x9dAnd later on:6 PM: When you arrive back in your room, you notice you have a message on your hotel iPad. You open it, and it takes you directly to the hotel's Facebook videos, and in particular, a video illustrating the hotel spa's offerings. Beneath the video is a \xe2\x80\x9cclick to reserve spa treatment\xe2\x80\x9d button. You do. And before setting the iPad down, you use the hotel's custom app to select and reserve a table at a recommended restaurant.It\xe2\x80\x99s all very clever technically, and doubtless responds to some guest needs, but I find this vision leaves me a bit cold. It\xe2\x80\x99s a future where the acme of customer service comes in the shape of rapid response to guest tweets, and where as many interactions as possible between guest and hotel happen seamlessly in cyberspace.

To increase your chances of being secure, think about your  personal human capital , a set of skills and experiences that will improve your finances in the future.     Establish yourself as an authority in your field and create a public image for yourself. When done well, this will help ensure that you and your skills will always be in demand as long as your field is relevant.  With technology, establishing yourself is easier today than it has ever been. The internet allows people with similar interests to connect easier, establishing communities and subcommunities offering enough room for many experts and leaders.    It starts with a blog. If you develop or write for a popular blog in your field, you could spread your authority far beyond your circle of colleagues. Blogging can open even greater opportunities to enhance your renown, including writing published books, appearing on television, and being cited as an expert when news organizations seek sources. The best news is that it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly easy to start a blog. Like a college degree is, for the most part, an entry point for a good career, a blog is the entry point for establishing yourself as a sought-after expert in your field.    Before you start a blog           If you\xe2\x80\x99re anxious to get started, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with starting a blog right away, particularly if your motivation comes in spurts. Not long after you begin, and before your blog can help you reach a level of authority, you\xe2\x80\x99ll most likely need to think about these questions. Take some time and get it right from the start by planning your blog.           What is your blog\xe2\x80\x99s mission?  The mission of Consumerism Commentary is \xe2\x80\x9cto develop financially literate, capable, and successful human beings by sharing educational, entertaining, and engaging writing.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, that mission guides almost everything I do related to this website. Consumerism Commentary has been around for eight and a half years, but I only created this mission recently. I formed the website for different reasons, but if I had focused on this mission from the beginning, the website may be more popular today.    As the context of this article is increasing your human capital, your blog will also have a \xe2\x80\x9csecret mission:\xe2\x80\x9d to establish you as an expert in your field.           What is your voice?  The growth of a blog and its owner\xe2\x80\x99s reputation within a broad community is related to the content on the website. If you\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on writing articles, read often, write often, and learn how to infuse your personality into your published thoughts. Even if you\xe2\x80\x99re already an established expert in your field, your skills may not immediately translate to engaging prose, so practice writing for the public.    If you plan to focus your website on video, again, practice being coherent and engaging in front of the camera. Find the approach you want to take with your voice, mannerisms, and attitude. You might change your approach later when you have a chance to test what works best in front of the audience, but the more you can prepare even by testing among your friends the better you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to quickly establish yourself once you start releasing your thoughts on the public.        What can visitors expect?  Do you want to produce content on a daily basis? Do you feel you\xe2\x80\x99d be better served by less frequent but more in-depth articles? Much of your decision might come after practice. Only then might you be able to determine what works best for you. At the outset, choose an approach and stick with it, only to provide some consistency.     What is your blog\xe2\x80\x99s name?  Sometimes this step comes first \xe2\x80\x94 a name inspires how you approach your blog. Your blog\xe2\x80\x99s name is your identity, and the choice might be affected by your ultimate plans for the website. If your goal truly is to establish yourself as an expert, tie the blog\xe2\x80\x99s name to your real name. If, on the other hand, you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in building your blog as a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d and selling it some day, tying your identity to your blog can limit your options. There are many approaches, but to increase your human capital, keep branding simple and make your real name prominent \xe2\x80\x94 the opposite of my initial approach to Consumerism Commentary.     Do you have a hook?  Again from a marketing and branding perspective, you may want to consider a concept to identify with.  Erica  was a web developer who started her own web hosting company, sold her business for $1.1 million, and is now a successful web-based entrepreneur, thanks in part to how she markets herself. She focuses on the business-selling aspect of her experience. This is the hook that draws people in, turning visitors to readers and readers to fans (not without a healthy dose of critics, as well). The hook works. What\xe2\x80\x99s yours?       How to start a blog    At the risk of sounding like an ad, I suggest visiting  WordPress.com  and starting a blog; it will take less than five minutes. There are other services out there, but WordPress is very popular and easy to learn. You will have an option to add extras to your blog, such as your own domain name. You may be reluctant to pay for some of the extra features like a domain name at first, but the fee is small and the benefit to your perceived expertise is worthwhile.     That mostly takes care of the technical aspect of getting started. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve established your framework, you can get started preparing your website for the initial launch. In a perfect world, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably like to have these tasks completed before releasing your blog to the public and letting the world know about it. If you are anxious to get your name out there, you might not feel like waiting. My suggestion is to get your website to a point where it has engaging and deep content before you launch, because this will show even your first visitor that you are serious about what you are doing.       Begin writing or posting regularly on your website, building an archive of content. Have enough to keep a visitor engaged. Consider having enough to keep someone engaged for an hour, reading, watching videos, or otherwise consuming your product, before promoting your new blog.    Select and customize a pleasing and navigable design. WordPress offers many options for your website\xe2\x80\x99s design and layout, and with a little practice, you should determine how you can customize both.    Determine how to categorize your content and build out these sections of your site. Typical layout calls for a small number of high-level sections listed near the top of your website. You should also have an area of your website dedicated to your personal information. Include who you are, why you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert, and a method of contacting you. Be sure to include any relevant information that could enhance your reputation.       Once your blog is established, you need to let people know of its existence. Find similar websites, participate in discussions, join communities, and determine how to use social media like Facebook and Twitter effectively. Use press release services like  PRWeb  to your advantage when there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to do so legitimately.     Move beyond your own blog    Publishing your thoughts to increase your human capital isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to blogs. A blog will help you promote your other writing and open doors for you, however. With an archive of great content, you will be able to point to your history of excellent writing when looking to advance your reputation beyond the confines of your own website.       Offer to write articles for other respected bloggers within your community.    Seek opportunities to contribute to major publications like newspapers or industry journals.    Take a specific idea and publish your own book or e-book.    Approach publishers with a concept for a book, pointing to your history \xe2\x80\x94 and importantly, the community of fans you\xe2\x80\x99ve built \xe2\x80\x94 as a rationalization for a book deal.    If you prefer developing video content over writing, look for opportunities to be on television, and perhaps, produce your own show.       The goal is to boost your human capital through establishing an expert identity for yourself. If you\xe2\x80\x99re well-respected online and are able to establish yourself beyond others in your field, potential employers and clients will seek you out. You will have more opportunities to grow your wealth and use that wealth to achieve the  real goals  you have for your life.    There is much more that could be said about developing a blog to promote yourself as an expert. Each aspect of creating a successful online identity, including creating content, mastering the most effective layout, and marketing yourself, has generated enough interest among the public to warrant blogs and books devoted to these topics. This overview doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even touch on directly  generating  revenue from your blog , but that is a separate goal from what is discussed here, establishing yourself as an expert. Focus on creating something that establishes you before worrying about income. The expense is minimal except for your time.     If you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about return on investment, keep in mind the goal is to increase your human capital, the benefit of which only reveals itself over a long period of time.    Keep in mind that  the bar has been raised.  It is easy to start a blog, so it takes much more than just starting and producing consistent content to establish yourself as an expert through your blog.

THE idea that the human personality is a blank slate, to be written upon only by experience, prevailed for most of the second half of the 20th century. Over the past two decades, however, that notion has been undermined. Studies comparing identical with non-identical twins have helped to establish the heritability of many aspects of behaviour, and examination of DNA has uncovered some of the genes responsible. Recent work on both these fronts suggests that happiness is highly heritable.As any human being knows, many factors govern whether people are happy or unhappy. External circumstances are important: employed people are happier than unemployed ones and better-off people than poor ones. Age has a role, too: the young and the old are happier than the middle-aged. But personality is the single biggest determinant: extroverts are happier than introverts, and confident people happier than anxious ones.That personality, along with intelligence, is at least partly heritable is becoming increasingly clear; so, presumably, the tendency to be happy or miserable is, to...    \r\n')

It involved someone (usually a psychologist or psychiatrist) asking someone else to look at ten inkblot images. In each case, the interlocutor inquires of the viewer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat might this be?\xe2\x80\x9d, notes the response and attempts to draw conclusions.The question has always been, of course, how reliable the connection is between the response to the blots (generally, people, animals or objects) and the alleged diagnosis.

They featured Peter and Jane, their dog, their house, their toys and the rest of their little world. Their dad went out to work and their mum stayed at home and looked after Peter and Jane. By the late 1970s, after a couple of updates, their world had changed slightly: dad did more things around the house and Jane was wearing jeans rather than skirts. But she still spent a lot of her time at home playing with her doll or helping mum. Peter preferred to be out and about with dad.  The books are still available, but their charm is now of the vintage variety.

For years, economists have sought debt data from both borrowers and lenders for credit card debt and four other debt categories. Borrowers report their debt balances by responding to household surveys, like the Survey of Consumer Finances. Lenders report debt to the credit reporting bureaus such as Equifax.     Relying on self-reported information for studies is always a risky approach if you\xe2\x80\x99re planning to make any scientific assumptions based on the data. Everybody lies. Or, in some cases, people think they know the answer to a question about how or why they do something, but the truth remain undetected. Asking a population of consumers  if they will transfer all their money from a big bank to a credit union  will always result in overstating the number, as people tend to respond as if they were their ideal versions of themselves. Surely, a quantifiable question such as their debt balances shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subject to this kind of error.    In fact, for most types of credit card debt, the self-reported balances match the issuer-reported balances. In only one category is there a discrepancy: credit cards.    Binyamin Applebaum from the Economix Blog explores some of the possible reasons that consumers misreport credit card debt. Among the possibilities:    Shame    Most of the other debt categories reported, such as student loans and home mortgages, tend to be socially acceptable. A consumer who feels embarrassed about a behavior or a state of being, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance he or she will be less willing to report it on a survey. Personal bankruptcies, on the other hand, could also be embarrassing, but households report them correctly.    Ignorance.    The study comparing the two debt reporting approaches show that single people report their credit card accurately while households do not. Household surveys are generally answered by only one person within the household, and that person may not be aware of the other person\xe2\x80\x99s debt, even if the family has chosen to combine accounts.     Interpretation.    If someone were to ask me how much credit card debt I have, I\xe2\x80\x99d say I have none. My  latest balance sheet  (net worth report) shows that is false. At the end of each month, I have a balance on my credit cards. I pay my credit card balance in full every month before it is due, but a snapshot on any date would show that I have a balance. People like me might report that they have no credit card debt, particularly if the question is not explained well on the survey. The issuers see it differently. They report a balance to the credit bureaus even if the issuers expect (or would expect if they note patterns) the borrower to pay in full.    When correcting for these issues, the researchers who conducted the study comparing the two reporting techniques still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain the remaining discrepancy. Issuers reported more than twice the amount of credit card debt borrowers reported. The only possible conclusion is that people just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much they owe on credit cards. The study concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cuninformedness\xe2\x80\x9d is the problem. People just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much credit card debt they have, even if statements make this information easily accessible, at least on a monthly basis.    Two important steps in taking control of your finances are to  take an inventory , finding where you stand in every financial account including debt, and to  track your money , knowing how much is coming in and going out, and when these changes happen.     Do you know how much credit card debt you have? Do you think it matches what your credit card issuers say you have?

(ADP) filed yesterday was a little like digging into a nice, tasty slice of pineapple upside- down cake.\xc2\xa0Why, you ask? Well \xe2\x80\x93 as with the cake \xe2\x80\x93 it turns out that some of the most interesting ingredients in the attachment to the regulatory filing were baked further down in the document, most notably, on page 6.    The attachment in question (Exhibit 10.1) is a November 14  Separation Agreement  that ADP gave to\xc2\xa0longtime president, CEO, and Director, Gary C. Butler, who\xc2\xa0 retired  on November 8 after a 37-year career with the company.    We had to read all the way down to 2.(q) to find out that ADP will pay Butler $1.55 million in January, 2012, as well as another $150,000 within 30 days of the agreement to compensate him for his FY 2012 bonus. (Based on our experience, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty unusual for a company not to summarize the terms in the body of the 8-K and then leave the details to the agreement)    Another goodie that Butler negotiated obligates ADP to provide the executive \xe2\x80\x9cwith appropriate office and secretarial support until Butler\xe2\x80\x99s 72nd birthday, which office will not, in any event, be located in an ADP facility.\xe2\x80\x9d Butler is 65 now, according to ADP\xe2\x80\x99s press release, so this benefit could last for another 7 years. The company also agreed to transfer title to the leased company car that Butler has been driving. The company estimated the value of these benefits to be worth $622,200 in its September 27  proxy , which seems like some pretty swank office space.    And there are other interesting terms, as well. For example, all of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s unvested stock options became vested on the day he resigned. According to the proxy, Butler\xe2\x80\x99s vested and unvested stock options were worth nearly $6.9 million (that number assumes that unvested options had vested immediately and were exercised on June 30, 2011). This is a big deal, because had the accelerated vesting not occurred, Butler\xe2\x80\x99s options would have vested in leisurely 20% increments over five years, starting a year after their grant date. The company also gave Butler the FY 2012 target grant amount of 65,000 shares of common stock under the Performance-Based Restricted Stock program. At yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s closing price of $52.44, that could be worth more than $3.4 million.    In all, the proxy showed that if Butler had retired on June 30, 2011, he stood to collect nearly $29.86 million from his equity interests, Supplemental Retirement Plan, Deferred Compensation account, health coverage, and the perks (the office, assistant\xe2\x80\x99s salary, and car). But as far as we can tell, the $1.7 million that the Separation Agreement promises to pay Butler is money in addition to the figure from the proxy. Think of them as a few extra cherries sprinkled on top of what he was already set to receive.    We know that Butler\xe2\x80\x99s retirement was expected at some point, and ADP already had a succession plan in place. At the same time that Butler retired, the company promoted Chief Operating Officer\xc2\xa0Carlos A. Rodriguez to serve in the top executive post.    And we should point out that Butler\xe2\x80\x99s tenure at ADP was profitable, a point that company Chairman Leslie Brun made in this Dow Jones Newswire  article  on November 9. Brun stated, \xe2\x80\x9csince he became CEO in 2006, revenues and profits have both increased significantly and the company is well positioned to continue its profitable growth.\xe2\x80\x9d With that being the case, perhaps shareholders won\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge Butler a few extra bites on his way out the door.

It would; the dollar would probably weaken against the yuan, which would probably result in a reduction in America's multilateral trade balance. This isn't guaranteed, of course. The dollar has been rising against the euro and many emerging-market currencies of late, mostly thanks to broader financial fear. The resulting shifts could offset depreciation against the yuan, and that's assuming that a China with fewer restriction on capital movements wouldn't be subject to the same capital outflows as other emerging markets. It does seem likely, however, that the American economy would adjust somewhat more easily given a floating yuan.   \r\n")

But when might it supplant America at number one? The answer depends on how the exchange rates are calculated. The IMF\xe2\x80\x99s forecasts and the long-run tables of GDP compiled by the late Angus Maddison, an economic historian, are based on purchasing-power parity (PPP), which makes allowances for the lower prices of non-traded services in poorer countries. On that basis, the size of China\xe2\x80\x99s economy is already close to America\xe2\x80\x99s and is likely to overtake it by 2016.  China is further behind when its economy is measured in current dollars (and much further in terms of GDP per person). America\xe2\x80\x99s GDP in 2010 was $14.5 trillion at current market prices; China\xe2\x80\x99s was $5.9 trillion. How quickly the gap is closed depends on three things: the relative speed of real GDP growth in China and America ...   \r\n')

After the Slate from Chase balance transfer offer became available, Citi responded with a sizable sign-up bonus for its balance transfer credit card. For a limited time only, new cardholders of the  Citi Diamond Preferred Card  will receive a 0% introductory APR on both purchases and balance transfers for 18 months, with a $200 up front statement credit and 3% balance transfer fee.    Cardholders qualify for the $200 statement credit after spending $500 online within the first three months of owning the card, which is not exactly the best situation for someone intending to use this card for the balance transfer offer. The best balance transfer offers are usually only good deals when the card is used solely for paying off the transferred balance, not for new spending. With a 0% introductory APR on purchases for 18 months, however, if new members intend on purchasing holiday gifts online, they could possibly reach the $500 threshold before the year is over. This new debt can be paid off just as easily at 0%.     If you plan to make an event out of Black Friday or Cyber Monday by shopping online, the $200 statement credit could be one of the most beneficial card offers.    Keep in mind that offer like these are not good for anyone who is not in control of their expenses. Good introductory offers can attract spenders to credit cards only to trap them into paying more interest down the road. Only take advantage of these offers if you are disciplined and have an emergency fund to draw from if your financial situation changes.       When you compare the  Citi Diamond Preferred Card  with the  no balance transfer fee Slate from Chase , there are two things to consider.  Any cardholder with a balance of $6,667 or more would save more money by transferring the balance to the Chase card because Citi\xe2\x80\x99s fee at 3% is greater than $200.   Conversely, with the Citi Diamond Preferred, the 0% interest rate lasts a full six months longer, so even if a consumer has to pay a few dollars more to transfer the balance, an additional six months may be worthwhile. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough call, but this new offer from Citi edges out the Slate from Chase in general, but you have to consider your own specific circumstances.    Once the introductory interest rate expires, the Citi Diamond Preferred Card, which has no annual fee, reverts to the following APR structure:       11.99% to 21.99% variable on purchases and balance transfers depending on quality of credit history    25.24% variable cash advance APR    29.99% variable default rate APR, initiated when a cardholder is consistently delinquent with late payments or over-limit charges       The holidays are a great time to get together with family and friends, but they also bring on the added pressure of buying gifts and spending money on holiday decorations and parties.   Don\xe2\x80\x99t dig a credit card debt hole deeper than you have to. Pay off all your purchases interest-free for 18 months with the  Citi Diamond Preferred Card .

self-actualization, if you concern yourself with your possessions. If you focus on acquiring gadgets, showering your children with toys, or achieving other materialistic pursuits, if you do so while neglecting the pursuit of including satisfying experiences in your life, you can never reach your full potential.     Even thinking about experiences beyond base needs is a luxury when abiding by Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s theory, because pursuing fulfilling experiences requires discretionary income or available cash. Anyone who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to meet the lower-level requirements in the hierarchy may need to devote all resources to health and safety. For those of us in the developed world who have benefited from a society that allows successful people to do as they choose with their financial surplus, we often face questions about how to spend that money with an eye towards increasing happiness.     As I\xe2\x80\x99ve found myself in a more comfortable financial situation over the last decade \xe2\x80\x94 and that comfort comes from an increased income and an ability to save for the future without sacrificing too much of my present \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve begun trying to find more ways to use surplus income (after meeting savings goals) to enjoy my life today. Financial writers often get caught up with the idea that people need to save as much money as possible for the future, but once there is some comfort with planning, there has to be an opportunity to enjoy life today.    Once my finances were on a solid path, I decided I was comfortable increasing today\xe2\x80\x99s expenses. The gateway for me was most likely moving into a new apartment. If my only income came from my day job, I might not have been able to comfortably move from a small apartment to a nicer, larger apartment without making sacrifices somewhere else. By moving into the newer apartment, I recognized that my income stream outside of my day job would be fairly steady, and that I had an emergency fund for back-up in the event of a disaster. I also accumulated things. With my day job, I was able to afford cable again, but with extra income, I was able to justify high-definition service and a new, high-definition television.     I was able to afford to buy cameras, lenses, and other photography equipment (several of which I still purchased used to save money), and to explore this hobby further. This gets into the topic at hand: experiences vs. things. While photography equipment consists of things, they are items that allow me to explore a hobby \xe2\x80\x94 or possibly a future business \xe2\x80\x94 and create experiences for myself. I attended classes at the local arts council to further develop my skills.    A study from 2003 building on prior research about materialism explains that using money to acquire experiences increases long-term happiness than using money to acquire objects. Here are some of the results:     As anticipated, respondents asked to evaluate an experiential purchase indicated that it made them happier than did those asked to evaluate a material purchase. Respondents also indicated that experiential purchases were better financial investments than material purchases. Participants indicated that, compared with material purchases, experiential purchases made them happier, contributed more to their happiness in life, and represented money better spent. Respondents were also less inclined to say that the money spent on experiences could have been better spent elsewhere than the money spent on material possessions.      The authors of the 2003 study also offer suggestions for the causes of these results. Why do experiential purchases result in happiness more than material purchases?        Experiences are more open to positive reinterpretation.  As time passes, view of history becomes rosier.     Experiences are more central to one\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  We are the sum of our experiences; people rarely identify with the items they\xe2\x80\x99ve collected around their house as much as they identify with experiences like travel, operating their own business, and spending time with family.     Experiences have greater social value.  People like sharing and talking about their experiences, and this type of discussion fosters better relationships than talking about possessions.       A follow-up study in 2010 goes further to explain why experiences are more satisfying. This study found that it was easy to compare a purchased item, such as a high-definition television, with other similar items at the time of purchase and looking back. When comparing experiences, such as a family trip to Disney World, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more difficult to make effective comparisons. Also, consumers are more likely to try to get the best deal when shopping for items with a strong field of comparable items but are more likely to  satisfice  when deciding to purchase an experience. Among other reasons, the researchers also determined that consumers are more likely to compare their material purchases with others\xe2\x80\x99 purchases while have a difficult time doing the same for experiential purchases.    You may be looking forward to the holidays, wondering what type of gifts would make your family and friends happiest. You can always play to the utilitarian point of view by purchasing gifts that the recipient might need, but to have the greatest impact, consider finding a way to offer an experience that everyone would enjoy. The benefits might not be immediate, but an experience could create memories that outshine this year\xe2\x80\x99s  hot Christmas toy  or latest Apple product for years to come.    Some experiential holiday gifts come to mind.        A weekend getaway.  Spend the weekend in a nearby city to save on transportation costs, and explore the town. This is something I did this past weekend in Philadelphia. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a gift, but I am sure my girlfriend and I are going to remember our scary experience at the Eastern State Penitentiary for the rest of our lives.     Dinner and a Broadway show.  Good food and entertainment combine to make lasting memories that enhance happiness. For those who attend Broadway shows more than once a year, find a way to make it more memorable, perhaps with a backstage tour, VIP seating, or meeting the cast.     Long-distance travel.  It\xe2\x80\x99s often less expensive to travel outside of the country than to travel across. Within the United States, there are almost endless opportunities for unique travel experiences as well. I will always remember the time I spent exploring Death Valley with my family.     An exciting activity.  My girlfriend seems interested in skydiving and hot-air-ballooning. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a big fan of either of these activities because I would like to  live  for a long time, but I know these are activities that would make her happy if she were to live to tell me about them.       Consider leaving behind the material this holiday season and increasing someone\xe2\x80\x99s long-term happiness by engaging in an activity or experience the memory of which will last a lifetime and become more favorable as time passes.

America is by far the biggest GM farmer, with 66.8m hectares under cultivation, 2.8m more than in 2009. As can be seen in our map, GM technology has been enthusiastically embraced in the Americas and in many Asian countries. By contrast, many European countries are subject to severe restrictions on growing GM crops. Developing countries are planting GM crops at a more rapid rate than rich countries. Brazil has added some 10m hectares since 2008 and overtook Argentina as the second-biggest grower in 2010. India, too, increased its area by over 10% last year. The most popular crop is soya, while the most common modification is tolerance to herbicides.      \r\n")

Wells Fargo Bank and Chase Bank have been  testing debit card fees in a small number  of locations within the United States, but due to the anger unleashed after the largest bank, Bank of America, announced it would add a $5 debit card fee in 2012, the two smaller (but still very large) banks backpedaled. Wells Fargo and Chase are unwinding their test plans, and the bank executives have decided not to continue charging more customers for the benefit of accessing their own funds on deposit.      A customer who deposits cash in a checking or savings account has been traditionally doing the banks a favor by allowing them to initiate loans based on the funds held in deposit. In return of this favor, banks paid depositors interest. With banks not lending as much as they have in the past, banks are in no rush to acquire depositors. Thus, they can pay much less interest and increase fees. They\xe2\x80\x99re happy to drive customers away.     Bank spokespeople also cite new regulations as rationalization for new fees. Particularly, the interchange fees banks charge retailers for accepting debit cards at the point of sale are now limited. In effect, banks are switching revenue-generation from retailers to depositors. With this new swipe fee regulation, retailers are now more protected than consumers.     Bank of America\xe2\x80\x99s new debit card fee policy stirred public unrest, and from a public relations standpoint, Chase and Wells Fargo would do well to avoid more public outrage. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be the end of this story for Wells Fargo and Chase. Corporations need to answer to their shareholders, and investors will not want to see a bank willingly part with revenue potential. While the banks are still making great profits in a \xe2\x80\x9cpost-bailout\xe2\x80\x9d environment, expect the executives to tap another source. Be on the look-out for new fees now that certain banks are avoiding debit card fees.

Update:  In response to the announcements from Wells Fargo and Chase, Bank of America offers a response. The bank will revamp its debit card fees, presumably by lowering the $20,000 minimum to avoid the monthly debit card fee. The bank has not made a decision, though, and unless the bank sees a mass exodus, expect the $5 debit card fee in 2012.     Second update:  The finance industry, minus Bank of America, is continuing to listen to customers. SunTrust and Regions Bank have announced that their customers will no longer be subject to the new debit card fees. This leaves Bank of America on its own. Will the largest bank buckle?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its most recent summary of the science behind its predictions, published in 2007, estimated that, in present conditions, a doubling of CO2 would cause warming of about 3\xc2\xb0C, with uncertainty of about a degree and a half in either direction.

They find that if you were to compare two executive directors, identical in every way except that one had 200 ex-colleagues now sitting on boards and the other 400, the latter, on average, would be paid 6% more.

The  Citi ThankYou\xe2\x84\xa0 Premier Card  is now offering a 50,000 ThankYou point bonus for new customers. Card holders need to spend $2,500 over the first three months of ownership to qualify for these bonus points, and as soon as they are credited to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s account, they can be redeemed for $500 in gift cards or $665 in travel. The potential bonus of $665 is the second largest currently offered by any credit card issuer (with the  Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards\xc2\xae Plus Credit Card  $800 bonus being number one).       In addition to the $665 travel bonus, the Citi ThankYou\xe2\x84\xa0 Premier Card offers 1.2 ThankYou points for every dollar spent at gas stations, supermarkets, drugstores, commuter transportation and parking merchants. All other purchases qualify for one point per dollar. Unlike other Citi cards, there is no annual maximum to the amount of possible rewards points. The points never expire.    Citi includes additional perks with the  Citi ThankYou\xe2\x84\xa0 Premier Card , including:       Earn points for the miles you fly when you purchase a ticket with your Citi ThankYou\xe2\x84\xa0 Premier Card.    Annual ThankYou point bonus of up to 5%.    No foreign transaction fee on purchases.    Annual complimentary domestic companion ticket (within the continental United States) and a 15% discount when booking air travel through Citi\xe2\x80\x99s travel benefits provider.       The Citi ThankYou\xe2\x84\xa0 Premier Card purchase APR is 13.99% to 22.99% variable, and the rate a cardholder will receive depends on credit history. The cash advance is an expensive 25.24% and the default APR is 29.99%. These are rates to avoid, so don\xe2\x80\x99t use this card for cash advances and make sure you pay your bill on time to avoid default. The one major drawback you\xe2\x80\x99ll find on this card is the $125 annual fee but it is waived for all first year cardholders.  Make sure you take full advantage of the rewards program and initial bonus if you plan to own this card for a long period of time.

Some financial experts advise avoiding credit cards completely, even those cards that offer rewards like cash back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a fan of this approach \xe2\x80\x94 again, for my own finances \xe2\x80\x94 because I see a credit cards as just another tool for personal finance. A hammer is inherently neither good nor evil; it\xe2\x80\x99s a tool that someone can use to fix a roof or to send another person to the hospital.     For a large portion of consumers, credit cards cause trouble. That may not be a reason to avoid credit cards entirely, as consumers can learn how to use credit cards effectively. Those of us who do believe we use cash back credit cards responsibly, paying bills in full every month, never paying interest, and buying only what we can afford, are relatively comfortable with the use of this tool, but even the best of us are subject to issuers\xe2\x80\x99 traps.    Cash back credit card programs include traps that help issuers recover the cost of paying out benefits to their customers. While some traps can be avoided by managing finances closely, other traps take advantage of the psychological aspects of using plastic rather than cash. These traps can be more difficult to avoid, because consumers cannot control their subconscious tendencies. Here are the cash back traps to avoid, if you can.    1. Credit card users spend more     The process of taking cash out of your wallet and handing that money to another person is a very deliberate activity, both physically and mentally. Parting with cash has psychological ramifications. In most people, particularly those who best understand the value of having money saved, the act of giving the cash away triggers the same reaction as a painful activity. Spending money and pain are linked in the brain.    When you use credit cards, you add a buffer between your cash and the process of parting with it. Spenders are less likely to hesitate and less likely to get that twinge of pain associated with handing over bills and coins. People familiar with computer science would call this a layer of abstraction. You\xe2\x80\x99re controlling your money by using a representation of that money, not the cash itself, and that makes the process feel better. In addition, cards with a rewards program like cash back encourage higher spending, because that cash back is seen as a reward that can be maximized by spending more.    Avoid this by making a concerted effort to buy only what you could afford with cash at any time.    2. Late fees and interest negate any cash back benefits          If you have debt that you carry over from one month to the next, forget about cash back rewards programs. The interest you pay eliminates any benefit you may receive from the issuer. Even if you manage to earn more cash back than interest you pay, consider that cash back credit cards often have higher interest rates than cards without any benefit program. While issuers advertise their cash back cards heavily, these cards should be used only by individuals who pay the bill in full every month. Late fees also negate cash back, so never pay the bill late.    Accidents and emergencies happen. It only takes one to erase a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of cash back. If you use a cash back credit card, make sure you tell your issuer to withdraw your payment in full every month, and make sure you have enough money in your bank account to cover your credit card bill at the right time. Have an  emergency fund  to cover yourself if you lose your job and can\xe2\x80\x99t pay your credit card bill from your income.    3. Rotating categories and opt-in requirements    Over the past year, credit card issuers have increased their cash back percentages in an effort to win back customers who miss the 5 percent cash back on all purchases during reward programs\xe2\x80\x99 heyday. This time, the higher benefits come with a catch. With tiered cash back, where some spending earns 1 percent, some earns 3 percent, and some earns 5 percent, issuers have become trickier. In many cases, the highest level of cash back is available only certain categories of spending, like gasoline or groceries, and the categories for which the companies make the cash back available rotate every three months. You have to pay attention if you want to keep track of how much cash back you should be earning.    Furthermore, some issuers require you to opt in to the highest cash back tier when the categories change every quarter. If you forget to contact the issuer, you don\xe2\x80\x99t earn the higher percentage.     4. Incorrectly categorized purchases    This has happened to me as well as many Consumerism Commentary readers who have shared similar experiences. If you shop around to various gas stations to save money, and your card offers a higher cash back on gasoline purchases, you may not get your full cash back. While stations with brands like Exxon/Mobile, Sunoco, and Shell are almost always categorized correctly, some of the smaller stations are not. Issuers maintain a list of vendors and their categories for earning cash back, but smaller retailers often don\xe2\x80\x99t make the list.     If you\xe2\x80\x99re in a period where gasoline purchases earn 5 percent and all other purchases earn 1 percent, if you shop at a less-expensive, off-brand gasoline station to save money, you may not receive the 5 percent cash back you should. Issuers are inflexible, and customer service representatives will often say that if a retailer is not categorized correctly, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing they can do to credit you the full cash back.     5. Cash back can be difficult to claim    One of the first cash back cards I used on a regular basis was the Citi Dividend Platinum Select, with which I earned 5 percent cash back on all purchases. Those were great days. But retrieving the cash I earned wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a perfect process. After earning $50, I was able to request that Citi send a check to the address on my account to cover my cash back. If I were to close my account before reaching the $50 cash back threshold, I would forfeit my cash back.    6. Cash back isn\xe2\x80\x99t always cash back    File this under misleading advertising. If a credit card issuer is offering cash back, I expect to receive cash back at the rate that is advertised, like 2 percent. That should mean that for every $100 I spend, I earn $2 cash back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the cash back be in the form of a gift card for a retailer. Many issuers have improved their labeling of these programs, but some problems still exist.     Some issuers still use the term \xe2\x80\x9ccash back\xe2\x80\x9d when referring to a statement credit. If a credit card company credits your statement once a year with the cash back you earn for the previous twelve months, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned cash back that you can use to deposit into savings, invest for the future, or buy yourself something additional. The issuer is keeping the cash back in its own hands by applying your cash back to your account. Assuming your statement credit is $300, you can take $300 of your own cash that you would have applied towards your credit card bill and use that to increase your savings or buy something else, but the idea that you\xe2\x80\x99re not receiving any real cash back from a cash back program is bothersome.    Additionally, if you close your account before your annual cash back credit, you might be forfeiting the portion of the benefit you earned.    7. Earning maximums and thresholds    With your favorite cash back card, or one that looks great on the surface, you may find that the fine print limits your cash back earning potential. Some of the highest cash back rates, particularly those 5 percent rotating categories, are limited. The highest rates may only apply to the first $1,000 in spending \xe2\x80\x94 or less. The \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest cash back credit card\xe2\x80\x9d that you may hear about in a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s commercials is the  Discover More Card . You can earn 5% cash back in rotating categories each quarter, but the 5% is limited to the first $300 spent in that category. That means that the most you can earn from the accelerated tier is $15 each quarter. Your spending in these categories may not exceed $300 over the course of three months, but if it does, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be leaving money on the table.    With some cards, like the  Blue Cash Everyday from American Express , you don\xe2\x80\x99t earn a higher cash back percentage until your spending $6,500 in a year. Purchases on the card in the highest tier after that point earn 5 percent, but until you reach that threshold, your purchases earn only 1.25%. In the lower tier, you can earn 1.25% after reaching the threshold, but only 0.5% beforehand.    8. Changing terms    Thanks to the  Credit CARD Act of 2009 , issuers have less flexibility to change your credit card terms without much notice. Issuers do have options if they want to move customers from a great cash back program to a less impressive program. The most used option is replacing one card type with another. When Citibank replaced the Dividend Platinum Select MasterCard with the Dividend World MasterCard, the cash back structure changed to be less beneficial for the customer. Even customers who opted out of the switch, which Citi approached as if it were mandatory for customers to accept, the cash back program was eventually reduced.    The benefits spenders receive today can change at any time. Credit card issuers react quickly to market forces; when one issuer offers a higher benefit, other issuers often respond within a week to remain competitive. The same reaction can happen on the opposite direction.    9. Some retailers are excluded    If your card earns 5 percent cash back at groceries stores, but you shop for groceries at Costco, Target, Walmart, or some other store that\xe2\x80\x99s not a pure grocery store or supermarket, you won\xe2\x80\x99t earn that higher tier of cash back. In fact, some of the big warehouse stores are excluded from cash back programs altogether. Some of these stores, often offering products at a discount compared to other stores, as well as small retailers who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay the higher interchange fees associated with some rewards cards, ban the use of cash back credit cards in their stores.     Shoppers may not be aware of this no cash back requirement until they have finished shopping. At the cashier, they are given the opportunity to buy all the products they collected from around the store with a card that offers no cash back, to pay for their items with cash, or leave the store without making their purchase. Most shoppers will simply forgo the cash back and buy the products anyway, as that\xe2\x80\x99s often a better option than considering the time spend in the store a waste and creating a necessity for shopping somewhere else.     10. Misleading conversion rates    As mentioned above, customers expect cash back programs to be straightforward. A 2 percent cash back rate should mean that every $100 earns $2 in pure cash. Some issuers make the conversion more complicated that it should be, by saying you can redeem your cash back for full value only through retail gift cards, and more flexible forms of rewards would cost more. For example, a $100 pre-paid debit card might cost $125 in cash back rewards.    This conversion obfuscation is aided by issuers who use a point system rather than a straight cash back system. Always be wary of point-based benefits if your goal is to earn cash back. When credit cards use points, they add a layer of abstraction between your reward earnings and your cash back, and issuers can do whatever they like with those points. Once you earn points, credit card companies can change their value relative to cash or change the price of the rewards for redemption.    Although some of the best maximizers can find ways to earn the most cash back from their spending, and some of the most focused work own a combination of credit cards to earn the highest cash back on all categories of spending at any one time, credit card issuers still have the upper hand. One mistake with a payment and you can throw away all the cash back you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned in a year. You may misunderstand the complicated terms or forget to opt in to this quarter\xe2\x80\x99s highest tier. Or, just like a large portion of credit card users, you may spend more than you would otherwise in search of a relatively small reward. Cash back credit cards are tools best used by those who have been trained to recognize these traps and fight the psychological impulses that allow spending to increase when using one of these tools.

This measures the amount of warming that can eventually be expected to follow a doubling in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its most recent summary of the science behind its predictions, published in 2007, estimated that, in present conditions, a doubling of CO2 would cause warming of about 3\xc2\xb0C, with uncertainty of about a degree and a half in either direction. But it also says there is a small probability that the true number is much higher. Some recent studies have suggested that it could be as high as 10\xc2\xb0C.  If that were true, disaster beckons. But a paper published in this week\xe2\x80\x99s Science, by Andreas Schmittner of Oregon State University, suggests it is not.

tracking my net worth and keeping my finances updated in personal finance management software since July 2003. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this mainly for myself. Posting my finances online helps make the numbers real. I use these monthly reports to hold myself accountable. If I write publicly about spending more in a budget category than I should, I have no one to blame myself if, at the end of the following month, I still have the same problem. I would have to face the judgment of readers who see my lack of progress. By keeping my finances public, I try to hold my money-related decisions to a high standard.    Over the past eight and a half years, this technique has helped me gain financial independence, combined with a thriving business. But this will be the final month I share my balances with this much detail. I\xe2\x80\x99m moving into the next phase of my financial journey, and this requires taking back some of my willingness to bare all for an audience. I will still share quite a bit, more than most readers would expect, but the familiar balance sheet will be replaced with a different accountability measure.    Another reason to move away from posting a monthly balance sheet for accountability is the fact that the swings from month to month have more to do with stock market performance than day-to-day money management decisions. When I had very little money invested and my expenses were close to my income, every decision I made could have a strong effect on my finances. That is not the case today. Just like my need for tracking every cent has been relinquished as my budget began to allow more freedom, my daily spending has a smaller effect than decisions pertaining to the larger picture, like my investment portfolio allocation and diversification. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be writing more about my investment choices in the future.    In October, my investments recovered. This contributed to an increase in my net worth. Continue reading to see the numbers.               Note that I took my business accounts out of this report a few months ago. Business income was healthy again in October, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not reflected in these numbers.    If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been following Consumerism Commentary, you should recognize the different lines included in my balance sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cCash in banks\xe2\x80\x9d includes all the checking and savings accounts I own, mostly  high-yield savings accounts . I added a new savings account in October, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what I wanted to do. I needed a signature guarantee in person, a service banks and brokerages often provide. I walked into my local Wells Fargo branch, but the representative had no idea what I was asking for. The next closest bank location was a Chase branch, so I walked in to ask whether they could provide a signature guarantee.     At Chase, the representative knew what I was asking for and was able to provide the signature guarantee for free \xe2\x80\x94 but only for Chase customers. Despite the proximity to  Bank Transfer Day , I opened a new account at Chase with a $100 cash deposit. In order for this checking account to remain free, I needed to initiate a $500 per month direct deposit or maintain a $1,500 balance. I covered both bases.     I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy with the idea of adding yet another bank account, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve also spent some time during the past few months canceling many of the savings accounts I\xe2\x80\x99ve opened over the past few years as tests for writing reviews on Consumerism Commentary. I closed or zeroed out my HSBC Advance account, Ally Bank accounts, Everbank accounts, Sallie Mae account, Discover Bank account, and Zions Bank account. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be canceling more accounts as I continue to  simplify my finances .    My investments line includes a few accounts for stock trading, mostly unused, as well as an individual brokerage account at Vanguard. My plan for this month is to look into moving my investments around so this account includes the most tax-efficient investments. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have tax-free investments in this account to reduce my tax liability, while leaving the less tax-efficient investments in retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.    Those 401(k) plans and IRAs are included in the retirement line in the above balance sheet. For the Honda Civic line, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been reducing the value of my car by $100 every month. This may be something I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t include in the report, but for a while, this was my most valuable asset, and since I could sell my car in an emergency, I thought it might be worthwhile to track. I occasionally check the car\xe2\x80\x99s value in Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see selling this car until it costs more to maintain than it is worth. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put very little money into the Honda Civic besides regular maintenance.    THe amount in my credit cards category is paid off every month. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using primarily a  Chase Continental Airlines OnePass Plus Card , and I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the miles earned for upgrades. With all the traveling I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this year, I\xe2\x80\x9dm very close to earning \xe2\x80\x9cSilver\xe2\x80\x9d Elite OnePass status in Continental\xe2\x80\x99s (and United\xe2\x80\x99s) frequent flyer program, but I might end the year without crossing the threshold of 25,000 Elite Qualification Miles. (With the OnePass Plus card, the miles you earn for every purchase do not help you qualify for a higher frequent flyer tier.)    As I mentioned above, my plan for November is to simplify my finances by reducing the number of open accounts. Next month, I\xe2\x80\x99ll report November\xe2\x80\x99s progress and review my finances as of the end of the month, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be changing the format. The monthly financial update is an integral part of this website, so I will find a way to continue this tradition despite the change of relevance.

Yet that\'s what\'s happened to me over the past few days, trawling around the eco-smug cities of Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas, talking to people about green jobs. The question is: what is a green job, exactly?I\'ve always thought about "green jobs" as the category covering work with explicit and intentional environmental benefits. Working on a wind turbine: yes. Making solar panels: of course. Organic farming: okay. Farming in general: not really. Teaching science in a public high school: an admirable endeavour, but not a green job. But there are lots of jobs that fall in a gray area. Tofu can be swapped for emissions-heavy beef; does growing soybeans count? What if you manufacture bicycles? The more you think about this, the more uncertain you become. Most jobs can be greened or at least greenwashed; in Portland, for example, there is a vegan strip club. On the other hand, you could make a Malthusian argument that no job is green because anything that creates value for people helps them and facilitates their attrition campaign against the earth.   \r\n')

Anyone who began their undergraduate studies in 2006 probably did so with the reasonable assumption that they\xe2\x80\x99d have a job after graduation. By the time these students graduated with bachelors\xe2\x80\x99 degrees, the economic situation offered a different reality. The unemployment rate for Americans between the ages of 20 and 24 as of September 2011 was 14.7% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.    Last year, the total amount of  student loan debt surpassed credit card debt  for the first time. Student loans and the value of an education is now such a popular debate that it sparked a discussion at dinner last night with several colleagues. With tuition costs rising much faster than inflation, the only financially responsible path to take is for a family to carefully consider  whether the expense of college is worth the benefit . If the only benefit is perceived in terms of financial return on investment (ROI), it can be very difficult in many cases to justify private school tuition.      One liberal arts graduate at the table pointed out that there is more to gain from education than immediate high salaries, and this is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed recently in terms of  building human capital . The expense of higher education is subject to  Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs . While citizens of the United States often consider higher education as a right, it is a privilege. While everyone should go to college, or at least have the opportunity to do so, being able to afford a school that matches any student\xe2\x80\x99s skills and desires can be beyond financial reach.     It is possible to earn a degree without going into debt , but when part of the American dream is providing every opportunity for our children to succeed without barriers, finances often don\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way. To make those dreams happen, someone often needs to sacrifice the future. Today, former students are sacrificing their financial well-being for the opportunity to have completed their degree at their preferred institution.    Last year, Congress agreed to some changes to the student loan industry to help students and former students struggling with student loan debt, and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPay As You Earn\xe2\x80\x9d plan expands on these benefits  for students with federal student loans, not private loans, with at least one loan borrowed directly from the government and one borrowed from a bank.        In 2012, borrowers will be able to reduce their monthly payments from 15% to 10% of their discretionary spending. The original law waited until 2014 to make this change.    In 2012, borrowers will be able to forgive the balance of their loans after 20 years of faithful payments, up from 25 years. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s law would have put this into effect in 2014.    Student loan consolidation will return, allowing current and recent students to save up to 50 basis points on their loans.       The student loan industry is dysfunctional. The availability of student loans makes it possible for colleges and universities to raise tuition without significantly affecting demand. By not solving the problem of rising tuition prices, the government gives a boost to the organizations, both semi-public and private, that finance and underwrite student loans. Furthermore, student loan debt is not forgivable in bankruptcy, unlike almost all other forms of debt. In a volatile job market,  it\xe2\x80\x99s riskier to have a student loan than it is to have credit card debt.     I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have children at some point, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like for them to have the opportunity to attend college. I would not like for them to need to sacrifice a significant portion of their future in order for them to receive the education that\xe2\x80\x99s best for them. At this rate in two decades, a college education at a private school will be unaffordable for middle class families without student loan debt that requires a lifetime of servitude.

Comments on Inequality, Leverage, and Crises--Kumhof &amp; Ranciere Nov 2010 IMF working paper   [guest post by Clifford D. Clark]    Michael Kumhof's and Romain Ranciere's November 2010 paper relates income inequality to national economic crises, particularly those experienced as the Great Depression and the Great Recession.  They conclude that increases in income inequality --comparing the top 5% of households to the bottom 95%--in the years leading up to the two crises exerted a determining influence on the economy.  ...  First, income inequality grew in similar ways in the years before the depression and the recent deep recession. ....  The authors find a link between the two phenomena:  income inequality increased at a greater rate than consumption expenditures in the years before the two crises. The public was spending at rates greater than increases in their income.  ...  Second, in the years before the recent downturn the growth in household debt  was due almost entirely to the bottom 95%. Real hourly wages of the top 10% of households increased by an accumulated 70% between 1967 and 2003, while the median households decreased by 5% and wages at the bottom 10% decreased by about 25%.  ...   That represents a clear switch:  whereas in 1983 the top wealth group was more indebted than the bottom 95%, by 2007 the reverse was true. By then the bottom 95% had debts equal to 140 % of income, nearly twice that of the top 5%. They conclude that almost all of the change in the debt to income ratio in aggregate was due to the bottom 95%.  ...  Third, an increase in debt requires and increased need for financial intermediation:  accordingly, the size of the financial sector between 1980 and 2007 increased considerably. Measured by the ratio of private credit of deposit banks and other financial institutions to GDP, that quantity increased from 90% in 1981 to 210% in 2007...        Their conclusion is succinctly stated.        \xe2\x80\x9c The key mechanism, reflected in a rapid growth in the size of the financial sector, is the recycling of part of the additional income gained by high income households back to the rest of the population by way of loans, thereby allowing the latter to sustain consumption levels, at least for a while. But without the prospect of a recovery in the incomes of poor and middle income households over a reasonable time horizon, the inevitable result is that loans keep growing, and therefore so does leverage and the probability of a major crisis that, in the real world, typically also has severe implications for the real economy. \xe2\x80\x9d Id. at 22.   * correction of source      \r\n")

Making those cells arrange themselves into something that resembles human flesh is, however, anything but. So-called tissue engineers have mastered the arts of artificial skin and bladders, and recently they have managed to rig up a windpipe for a patient whose existing one was blocked. But more complicated organs elude them. And simpler ones, too. No one, for instance, has managed to grow bone marrow successfully.  At first sight, that is surprising. The soft and squishy marrow inside bones does not look like a highly structured tissue, but apparently it is. That does not matter for transplants. If marrow cells are moved from one bone to another they quickly make themselves at home. But it matters for research. Bone marrow plays an important role in the immune system, and also in bodily rejuvenation. Stem cells that originate within the marrow generate various sorts of infection-fighting blood cells and also help to repair damaged organs. However, many anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs are toxic to marrow. That ...   \r\n')

A preliminary reading for November pegged the gauge at 64.2. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a final November result of 65, with consumers somewhat cheered by lower gas prices, but concerned about stock volatility. The sentiment gauge, which covers how consumers view their personal finances as well as business and buying conditions, averaged about 87 in the year before the start of the most recent recession. Economists watch sentiment data to get a feel for the direction of consumer spending. A separate report from the government on Wednesday showed that personal consumption spending slowed down in October.                                            \r\n')

After the introductory period, the interest rate reverts to a standard APR of 15.24% variable.

For business owners who haven\xe2\x80\x99t established credit in the business\xe2\x80\x99s name, credit card issuers generally rely on the owner\xe2\x80\x99s credit history. So even without a business credit history, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to be approved. Many small business cards are offering up-front rewards for signing up. The newest offer on the market is the  CitiBusiness\xc2\xae World Card , offering new account holders a $100 bonus in the form of points.       New customers must spend $300 on the card during the first three months to qualify for this sin-up bonus. When a new cardholder satisfies this requirement, Citi will add 10,000 ThankYou points to his or her account immediately. Customers can redeem these points for cash, travel, or $100 in gift cards. The Citi Business World Card also offers points for every purchase using the following schedule.       Three ThankYou Points for every dollar spent on purchases at certain office supply merchants and on professional services.    One ThankYou Point per dollar spent on other purchases.       Also, business owners who order additional cards for employees will earn ThankYou Points for the employees\xe2\x80\x99 purchases.    Unfortunately, the conversion between ThankYou Points and cash back is not the standard consumers have come to expect. Normally, card issuers allow a conversion of 100 points to one dollar in cash back. The ThankYou Points convert at that rate when redeeming gift cards, and most customers will find this to be the best use of the points. ThankYou points never expire. Unlike most Citi consumer (non-business) cards, there is no limit to the amount of points a business owner can earn each year.    One of the strongest benefits of the  CitiBusiness\xc2\xae World Card  is that it functions similarly to a charge card while still maintaining the features of a credit card. The card has no pre-set spending limit, so if a customer completes a purchase that causes the account to exceed the stated credit limit, Citi may still approve the transaction, without assessing a penalty or fee. If Citi does approve a purchase that sends a cardholder over the limit, the issuer allows a full statement cycle to pass to pay the over-limit amount before charging interest and fees. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only card I know of that offers this feature, which could come in handy in some situations.    Citi also provides a 0% introductory APR on purchases for six months, and after this introductory period, the rate reverts to the standard of 13.24% variable, which is considered low in today\xe2\x80\x99s market. With no annual fee, the  CitiBusiness\xc2\xae World Card  is a great option for any business owner looking to make organizing finances a little easier.

The new card offers cardholders the opportunity to earn 30,000 bonus ThankYou points, redeemable for $300 in gift cards.  This is a big boost over the typical offer for this card, 10,000 points. Unlike many other bonus credit card offers, this one comes with a disadvantage of delayed gratification; earning the full bonus requires meeting three separate criteria. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the  Citi Forward\xc2\xae Card \xe2\x80\x93 $300 in Gift Cards  offer  particularly attractive, but for young professionals with a fresh credit history, it may be the best card available today.       In order to earn the full 30,000 ThankYou point bonus on the  Citi Forward\xc2\xae Card \xe2\x80\x93 $300 in Gift Cards  offer, a new cardholder must do the following:       Spend $500 in the first three months of card ownership to receive the first 10,000 ThankYou points.    Spend $1,000 in months four through six of card ownership to receive the second set of 10,000 ThankYou points.    Spend $1,500 in months seven through nine of card ownership to receive the last set of 10,000 ThankYou points.       As you can see the barriers to earning this full bonus aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly large, but it will take some time before the full 30,000 ThankYou points can be realized. You can meet these criteria while paying your balance in full every month; in fact, this is important to do, because any interest you pay will decrease the value of this offer.    This card also includes a rewards program that offers two ThankYou points for every dollar spent at restaurants and on books, movies and music, and Citi offers One ThankYou point per dollar on all other purchases. There is no limit to the amount of points you can earn every year, and the points never expire. Points are more valuable when converted into gift cards and travel than cash.    The  Citi Forward Card \xe2\x80\x93 $300 in Gift Cards  offer has a variable interest rate on purchases and balance transfers of 13.99% to 21.99% depending on credit history. Citi will reduce your APR by 2 percentage points when cardholders make payments on time and spend within their limits. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only card marketed today that offers the perk of a reduced APR. There is no annual fee for using this card.     The $300 gift card bonus is available for a limited time only on select websites like Consumerism Commentary.  Consider applying for the  Citi Forward\xc2\xae Card \xe2\x80\x93 $300 in Gift Cards  offer, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re just getting started in your professional career and don\xe2\x80\x99t have the excellent credit (this card requires a good credit score, but not necessarily excellent) other top-of-the-line credit cards require.

Earlier this year, Discover was the first issuer in years to launch a no balance transfer fee credit card, realizing that no other issuer was willing to put an offer like this forward. Today, Discover has continued their recent run of aggressive promotions by offering a $150 cash bonus to all new Discover More Card members.    The $150 cash bonus that all new  Discover\xc2\xae More\xc2\xae Card  holders can receive comes after spending $1,000 during the first 90 days of card ownership.  The cash bonus will be added immediately to the statement after the 90 day period has expired.  As an added perk, this version of the Discover More Card is offering 2% cash back on all Amazon.com purchases during the first billing period (first 30 days of card ownership), but only up to $250 spent.  After that, Discover reduces the Amazon.com cash back bonus to 1%. (That\xe2\x80\x99s a total of $5 cash back under the 2% tier, but unlimited cash back under the 1% tier.)       Year in and year out, consumers consider the Discover More Card to be among the top three cash back credit cards.  The rewards program offers 0.25% cash back on the first $3,000 spent annually, then 1% on all purchases thereafter.  Discover also offers 5% cash back on select purchases every month. Here is the full 2011 calendar including the categories of spending that earn the 5% cash back.       January through March: travel and restaurants    April through June: home and fashion    June: groceries and drug stores    July through September: gas, hotels, movies and theme parks     October through December: restaurants and fashion        Unfortunately, the  Discover\xc2\xae More\xc2\xae Card  comes with a significant setback related to the 5% categories. The cash back you can earn at this bonus rate is subject to a limit.  The maximum amount of cash back that cardholders can earn in any period at the 5% level is $15.   Once a consumer has reached this amount, he\xe2\x80\x99ll receive 1% cash back on all future purchases with no limits.     The cash back never expires and is automatically credited on each statement.  When shopping online through the Discover Mall, customers can earn an additional 5% to 20% cash back on their spending.    The Discover More Card comes with a 0% introductory APR on both purchases and balance transfers for six month. After the introductory rate expires, the variable APR is 11.99% to 20.99% depending on credit history.  The balance transfer fee is 3% if the balance is transferred by February 10, 2012 or 5% anytime after that date. There is no annual fee for this card.    With the holiday season quickly approaching, having a cash back credit card is a great asset to help save money on gifts, travel or any other expenses.  The Discover More Card\xe2\x80\x99s $150 cash back bonus is a decent offer, but it will be available for a limited time.

They featured Peter and Jane, their dog, their house, their toys and the rest of their little world. Their dad went out to work and their mum stayed at home and looked after Peter and Jane. By the late 1970s, after a couple of updates, their world had changed slightly: dad did more things around the house and Jane was wearing jeans rather than skirts. But she still spent a lot of her time at home playing with her doll or helping mum. Peter preferred to be out and about with dad.The books are still available, but their charm is now of the vintage variety. When they were first published, families in most industrial countries were just like Peter\xe2\x80\x99s and Jane\xe2\x80\x99s. In America in the early 1970s more than half of all families with children consisted of a breadwinner husband, a stay-at-home wife and two or more kids; now only a fifth do. Instead there are lots of single-parent households, and even if couples live together they no longer...    \r\n')

0.5660922250999868, 1.5294988018547986, 0.34606524018691931, '       While saving money, reducing expenses, and earning income all help improve your net worth, these tactics often ignore the larger picture. Improving your personal human capital is like a form of insurance; you\xe2\x80\x99re protecting your ability to increase your net worth over a long period of time.  Boosting your human capital  through gaining education, adding variety to your experiences, and cultivating your network can help to ensure you\xe2\x80\x99re in a better financial position in the future.      I\xe2\x80\x99m what Carl Jung would call an Introvert.  To be more specific, in the variety of corporate psychological analyses I\xe2\x80\x99ve participated in over the past fifteen years, my result is generally halfway between Introvert and Extravert, though I identify more with the Introvert qualities. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I always prefer to work by myself or spend time alone; it means that I can draw energy from independent thinking. I am comfortable in social situations with large groups of people as well as working in teams, but rather than drawing energy from this type of socialization, it draws energy from me.     As a result of this energy drain, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put as much effort into networking as an independent business owner like myself should have. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been building online communities of various types since at least 1990, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done a great job with maintaining relationships over time. From a social perspective, I prefer to have a few close contacts than a large number of acquaintances. Not only does this make it difficult for people to get close to me, but it has perhaps damaged my personal human capital.    When to say yes    The overworked and overscheduled business owner receives standard advice: \xe2\x80\x9cKnow when to say no.\xe2\x80\x9d One person cannot do everything, and those who have shown themselves to be experts are often faced with ceaseless requests for assistance. Focusing effort on the 20 percent of requests that have 80 percent of the most relevance to the expert\xe2\x80\x99s own needs, an approach that borrows from the  Pareto principle , might benefit from lighter schedules but might miss the opportunity to have a significant effect on someone\xe2\x80\x99s life.    Keeping in mind that it could be damaging to over-promise and under-deliver, I take the approach of responding to as many requests as possible, looking at each as an opportunity to connect with someone I may not know about.     Both depth and breadth are important    I mentioned above that I\xe2\x80\x99m more comfortable with fewer close relationships than more superficial connections. This limits my capacity for improving my overall human capital. The most beneficial network contains both deep relationships and a wide network.     An individual beginning a new business as a landlord or real estate investor is a good example of someone whose human capital increases significantly with a wide network. In order for an investment to be profitable, unless the investor intends to spend all of his time and effort handling every detail regarding the property, he or she needs to know a variety of people in positions to help. While one can find plumbers, contractors, painters, property managers, and real estate agents by searching online, the best help \xe2\x80\x94 and the better deals \xe2\x80\x94 would come from people the investor knows personally. Recommendations from friends or other investors could fill in some holes in the network, and every interaction through a recommendation can grow this network.    For someone building a photography business, initial help could come from the deeper relationships in the individual\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle, those who would trust the photographer enough to help build an initial portfolio and be willing to recommend the photographer to friends in the early stages of the business.    The value of online networking tools    LinkedIn has become the one location for the best business-focused networking. Despite this, I am not convinced that online-only networking \xe2\x80\x94 or just having a massive contact list \xe2\x80\x94 is valuable. I receive connection requests every day from people I\xe2\x80\x99ve never communicated with, whether in person or through email. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the benefit of growing the list just to have a high connection count, just like the purpose of earning more money or reducing expenses is  not  just to have a larger bank balance.     As LinkedIn has grown, more features seem to invite unwanted messages and self-aggrandizement. I see LinkedIn as an effective contact management system, where you can be sure your most important contacts also offer their latest information. This is much more efficient than maintaining a Little Black Book when contacts frequently change jobs, positions, email addresses, and phone numbers.    Professional organizations    Starting in college, you can join professional organizations that provide opportunities to expand your network and open opportunities that might not have been available otherwise. As a music education major, I re-established the university\xe2\x80\x99s collegiate chapter of a major national organization related to the field. Had I remained in this field, I would have been able to draw upon the contacts I established at this organization for professional opportunities. (You never know what path your life might take, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to prepare for the path you intend to take at any particular time.)    In my career as an independent financial blogger, it was rewarding to establish an informal association of like-minded writers. As a small, tightly-knit group, we could easily share ideas and best practices to help our budding businesses grow.    Mentoring relationships    Focusing on the depth rather than breadth of connections, the relationship between a mentor and protege can be a helpful for building personal human capital. Seeking a respected individual in your field to play the role of a mentor can help you have an avenue for asking direct questions where the answers will help you reach your goals. No matter where you are in life, there is always someone from whom you can learn. Even the most successful individuals in the world find time to speak to people they respect to come away from a discussion with more ideas or tools.    At the same time, being a mentor can be very rewarding. Often, a protege asks a question that forces you to solidify your thoughts and opinions. By talking through your approach to any particular issue helps you think about details that may seem self-explanatory. In the variety of relationships in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve served as a mentor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned more about myself and my life and business have both improved as a result.    One danger in this relationship is being defined by the role in nominal terms. Mentors can learn from proteges. Everyone has something to offer.    Five tips for building an effective human network        Be authentic.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t present yourself as someone you\xe2\x80\x99re not.     Reciprocate.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t take more from a relationship than you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to give. Say yes often.     Focus on depth and breadth.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t just be a contact collector. Add depth to the relationships that matter most.     Facilitate connections.  Rather than focusing solely on the relationships that will help you, note where your contacts will benefit from building a relationship with your other connections.     Follow meetings with a message.  Responding or connecting quickly after a meeting will help build relationships faster.        Do you have any additional tips for networking?

The post had the flavor of a thought experiment, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any talk to implement this.    Nonetheless, the thought of that idea sends a cold chill down my spine, not just because I like my perks \xe2\x80\x94 I do \xe2\x80\x94 but because the groups that might be calling for the change will be shooting themselves in the foot.\xc2\xa0 Getting the powers that be to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep you from getting yourself into trouble\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect you from that bully\xe2\x80\x9d , play big brother, or to keep that bully from picking on you is counterproductive, because the energy expended at complying with the powers that be are non-productive.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a burden to everyone, and  it hurts just about everyone.     The beauty of credit cards, if you have good credit, is that you can basically choose what terms you want and what perks you want. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit like ringtones. I have as my weapon of choice the I have the  Chase Sapphire\xc2\xae  card. Every once in a while, I get enough points that I can cancel a charge from my bill. I like that! Other people have airline cards, or Starbucks cards, or whatever. Why the heck not?\xc2\xa0 Whatever floats their float!     If merchants push for this, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get bitten too     Supposedly the reward cards carry higher interchange fees than non-reward cards, and this directly hits the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 bottom line. \xc2\xa0 So banning these cards will help the merchants, right?\xc2\xa0 Wrong.\xc2\xa0 When the merchant account providers are restricted in what they can do to make money, they\xe2\x80\x99re not just going to sit there.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it up some other way.\xc2\xa0 Consider that merchant account providers  can no longer demand  that merchants accept all credit card transactions, regardless of amount.\xc2\xa0 Some merchants will set minimum charge amounts, and the issuers won\xe2\x80\x99t see that interchange income.\xc2\xa0 If we ignore the fact that the merchant is probably going to lose customers, then the issuers will bump up their prices, charge extra fees, etc., to make up the new shortfall.    It\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing with getting rid of reward cards.\xc2\xa0 Once the financial advantage of carrying a reward card goes away, then a number of things can happen.\xc2\xa0 First, the additional income that the issuers got from the reward cards will be made up somehow.\xc2\xa0 Second, the people who were using the card will use them less now that the fun has been taken away.\xc2\xa0 Less money flying around means less money for the merchants.\xc2\xa0 Third, it\xe2\x80\x99s one more measure of oversight that is a non-productive drag on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The short-term gain in interchange fee expense will be handed back, and then some.    If there\xe2\x80\x99s a ban on reward credit cards, what about low-interest cards?\xc2\xa0 High-risk (high-rate) credit cards?    What about credit cards in general?\xc2\xa0  That\xe2\x80\x99s the danger of banning any kind of credit card.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a step toward banning more. \xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the erosion of choice.

get a new  HDTV  for the holidays might be starting to narrow down the choices. We\'ve seen a  number of great deals  being offered for the event, but we also believe that TV promotions will continue right through the new year, so don\'t be discouraged if you miss out on a Black Friday special.      In fact, based on  a recent analysis  we did with the price-prediction website Decide.com, in a significant number of instances the lowest prices of the season were offered not on Black Friday or Cyber Monday but later in the year. Still, if you do intend to do some TV shopping on Black Friday this year, here are 10 deals  that caught our attention:       1. Sharp 42-inch 1080p LCD TV (LC-42SV49U), $200 at Best Buy.  Not surprising, given its shockingly low price, this is a doorbuster special from Best Buy, available in limited quantities at store locations. This is a fairly basic 1080p LCD set, though it does have four HDMI inputs. Sharp has been a somewhat inconsistent performer in our Ratings, but it\'s still hard to beat a TV that\'s priced like a microwave oven.       2. Westinghouse 46-inch 1080p LCD TV (VR-4625), $298 at Target.  Westinghouse TVs have typically been among the lower-ranked sets in our Ratings, but this fairly basic model&#8212;a 60Hz set with a CCFL (fluorescent) backlight&#8212;might be just the ticket for budget-conscious shoppers looking for a TV for a secondary room of the house.        3. Vizio 47-inch 3D LCD TV (XVT3D474SV), $938 at Amazon.  This 47-inch 3D TV from Vizio is loaded with features, including a full-array LED backlight with local dimming, the equivalent of 480Hz technology, built-in dual-band Wi-Fi, and Vizio\'s VIA suite of Internet apps and services, including streaming movies and TV shows. The set is a passive-3D model and comes with four sets of  lightweight polarized glasses.       4. Dynex 55-inch 1080 LCD TV (DX-55L150A11), $600 at Best Buy.  This might be an appealing option for those looking for a larger set with a few extra features, such as 1080p resolution and 120Hz anti-blur technology. It has four HDMI inputs, which are also a plus. Dynex TVs have done well in our TV Ratings, generally offering very good overall performance at a fairly low price.       5. Samsung 51-inch 720p plasma (PN51D430), $498 at Walmart.  This is a basic 720p plasma from a brand that has typically done well in the CR TV Ratings. It uses the company\'s narrow-bezel  "Plus One"  design to squeeze an extra inch of screen. (Sears is selling this TV for just one dollar more as part of its early CyberMonday sale today.)       6. Zenith 50-inch 1080p plasma (Z50PV220), $500 at Sears.  We\'ve seen plasma TVs at this price, but seldom a 1080p model. For the past two years, Sears and Kmart have been rolling out low-priced Black Friday sets bearing the  Zenith brand , and this year is no exception. It\'s a basic 1080p plasma.       7. Panasonic 46-inch 720p plasma TV (TC-P46X3), $400 from Best Buy.  Like Samsung\'s, Panasonic plasmas typically do very well in our TV Ratings, and we purchased this set earlier this year for more than $600. Despite its lower resolution, it has a good number of features, including the ability to accept an optional Wi-Fi adapter and Panasonic\'s EZ IPTV Internet platform, with access to streaming movies and TV shows.       8) Emerson 32-inch 720p LCD TV (LC320EM1-SF), $188 at Walmart.  this is a very basic 720p LCD TV from Emerson, a brand controlled by Funai. It might be a good choice for those looking to outfit a spare bedroom or guest room with a basic, low-priced set. We\'ve seen this set for close to $350 on various sites. Walmart will also have a 40-inch Emerson set for $248.       9. LG 47-inch 3D LCD TV and Blu-ray player bundle, $799 at Walmart.  Walmart has created a 3D package consisting of LG\'s 47LW5300 1080p 3D LCD TV, plus an unnamed 3D Blu-ray player and four sets of lightweight polarized glasses. The TV, which uses passive 3D technology, has a decent number of features, including an edge LED backlight and a 120Hz refresh rate, but it doesn\'t include the company\'s Smart TV Internet platform. If you\'re looking to go bigger, both Amazon and Walmart have a similar bundle with LG\'s 55-inch 55LW5300 3D set for just under $1,250.       10. Three big-screen specials at Best Buy and Walmart, $800 to $1,000.  Here are three options for those looking for very big TVs:       \t Sharp 60-inch 1080p LCD TV (LC60E79U), $800 Best Buy. A major-brand 120Hz set.    \t Westinghouse 60-inch 1080p LCD TV VR-6025Z), $800 at Best Buy. Normally this 120Hz set is $1,000.    \t Toshiba 65-inch 1080p LCD TV (65HT2U), $998 at Walmart. A 120Hz set that, based on our experience with the Toshiba TVs in our Ratings, would benefit greatly from an external sound system.           These are just some of the best deals we\'ve seen offered for Black Friday, so let us know what\'s on your radar this year. To make the most of these, and other, specials, make sure you read our blog with  12 tips for getting the best Black Friday deals.  And remember that the cheapest TV doesn\'t always mean it\'s the best deal. Since you\'ll likely own the set for a good number of years, make sure you one that really fits your needs.    \r\n')

There are many discounts being offered for Black Friday, though some prices are clearly better than others. It can be time consuming to scan sales flyers and determine the true standout deals on good navigators. To speed things along, we&#8217;ve done the homework for you, highlighting the best offers from major retailers.      In scouring the ads, we noticed this year that the focus is on newer devices from top-name brands. It used to be that there were GPS units from smaller companies and electronics giants whose primary focus is not navigation. Plus, many of the units with the most tempting prices were one, two, or even three generations old. This year, the pickings are much better, but shoppers are still facing some tough choices.       As you look through the offers, and our  online ratings , it is key to determine your must-have attributes, such as screen size, Bluetooth connectivity, and traffic services. In scanning the ads, we see that models often offer lifetime maps, lifetime traffic, and sometimes even both. It is far more cost effective to purchase these features upfront than add them later. The real pitfall here is that some units without those options are likely to get the real head-turning prices. It is your choice if you think the way you use the device will favor these services (we find them worthwhile), but the important thing is to know what you&#8217;re buying.       In addition to discounts on portable devices, navigation app providers typically offers discounts for Black Friday and often again in December. If you&#8217;re a smart phone user looking for some extra guidance, hold out for reduced prices.  Navigon just announced  a temporary price drop in its latest apps, and the competitors are sure to follow.       To compile the best deals list, we scoured major electronics retailers and deal sites, including many more than featured. Of course, in this competitive market, more attractive deals may be available, but this provides an excellent start. We avoided refurb models, which were the focus for some online electronics retailers. A basic description is provided to help sift through the listing, but we recommend visiting the model pages at ConsumerReports.org for ratings, features, and an explanation of performance. In some cases, multiple listings are included for a popular model, as stores may or may not be available locally, and online retailers may provide free shipping.       Many retailers are offering the same prices online as in the store. Given that there are real risks that an individual store may run out of stock before you can negotiate your way to the shelves, consider buying online. It may better your chances, reduce stress, and potentially avoid sales tax.       Below, we highlight our picks for the best Black Friday deals on GPS devices.

It is biodegradable, safe enough to be used as food packaging, can be processed like existing thermoplastics into coloured or transparent material and can be manufactured from renewable resources such as maize and sugarcane.

Now a group of researchers led by Lee Sang-yup of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology say they have come up with an even better way to make PLA, using the emerging science of synthetic biology.  At the moment PLA is usually made in two stages. First, a source of starch or sugar, ...   \r\n')

In fact, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a stretch to consider your human capital, your potential to become financially independent over time, more important than your net worth at any one particular time. Over the past few weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing in depth about ways to boost your human capital through education, experience, and particular approaches to life decisions. This is the final article in the series.     Assuming the stock market provides a average return of 8 percent per year over the long-term, the earlier you begin investing, the better you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the future. Thanks to the way returns compound upon each other, starting a few years earlier could be the difference between retiring comfortably and struggling on a fixed income. Of course, market performance in the future will have a great effect on your overall performance, but those who start early generally have a distinct advantage.    The same theory applies to building your human capital. \xe2\x80\x9cStart early\xe2\x80\x9d is generally the worst advice anyone can communicate because it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. Until scientists invent a time machine, by the time someone says to you, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have started earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d you\xe2\x80\x99ve missed your opportunity. If the message of starting early get across, however, the philosophy can be used for other situations and can be passed along to others. For example, while I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save any of my income until I was in my late twenties, now knowing that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to start early, I can help my potential children understand this importance from an earlier age.     While many financial experts have succeeded in convincing people that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to start saving and investing early to maximize the advantage offered by time, not many people talk about developing your human capital early.     High school    By the time you finish your first year of high school, you should be well on your way to a financially successful life by exploring your talents and interests, taking part in extra-curricular activities, and looking for opportunities to lead others. It sounds like a lot to ask of a fourteen-year-old kid, but if parents help steer children in the right direction without overloading them, these basic tenets will go far in helping the child develop into a successful adult.    Besides grade point averages and standardized test scores, the criteria that colleges use to evaluate potential students for acceptance, criteria which schools believe correlate to success, tend to be the same aspects that build human capital. Those extra-curricular activities, leadership roles, volunteer work, a diverse set of interests, and the ability to write an essay well all help a student convince an admissions board that he or she will thrive in the college environment.     College    The college experience varies from person to person. You could gain a lot of maturity between ages 18 and 21, or you could spend four years wasting your life like so many students away from their parents for the first time.

In May 2010 Michael Gove, the Conservative education secretary, allowed schools judged \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d by the schools inspectorate to follow. More than 1,000 excellent schools and 200 poor ones have since converted. A third of secondary schools are now academies.

The OECD, a rich-country think-tank, suggests that children taught in autonomous schools do better than those who attend schools where teaching is tightly prescribed.
