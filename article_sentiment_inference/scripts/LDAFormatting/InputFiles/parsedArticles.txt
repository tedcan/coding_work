everyone afford healthcare insurance purchase upon penalty payment regulatory course issue get almost news media attention thank loud party republican rightwing talk show personalities cry mandate unconstitutionally violate individual liberty therefore beyond congress’s authority under constitution’s commerce clause commerce clause give congress power regulate interstate commerce under supreme

compel purchase medical insurance retirement savings medicare social security mandate under commerce power infringe more individual liberty mandate under power these point originally post late june days before sixth circuit court appeal judge jeffrey sutton highly regard conservative reagan appointee prominent federalist society member early career serve year clerk justice scalia eloquently deconstruct conflation majority opinion uphold constitutionality individual mandate reiterate point post sutton opinion sillily title “judge sutton channel summarize post early october discuss oral

echo basics judge sutton’s opinion commerce clause give congress authority regulate affect interstate market healthcare market clearly decision purchase healthcare insurance inactivity instead clearly market activity because unlike proverbial decisions whether purchase broccoli vehicle virtually everyone need healthcare some point receive whether person insure afford medical bill pocket infringement individual liberty objection commerce clause issue instead process issue individual mandate provision unconstitutionally infringe upon individual liberty silberman’s opinion adopt sutton’s reason respect most interest think—partly guess because feel like proprietary interest it—is conclusion appellants’ view individual cannot subject commerce clause regulation absent voluntary affirmative enter affect interstate market express concern individual liberty seem more redolent process clause arguments foundation commerce clause kavanaugh dissent liberty ground even commerce

 mike kimel scale depths scott sumner back forth scott sumner here latest post helpfully entitle suggestion mike kimel suggestion please close look data great depression before more post claim don’t know facts then point study period years there explain first mistake insist fdr’s dollar depreciation program begin october even though economic historians agree begin april exchange rate dollar begin decline against gold against other currencies insist price begin rise before take office true present graph claim show price rise before take office graph show inflation rate price level fact graph actually support argument inflation didn’t turn positive until take office there’s difference between rate inflation price level redo graph show inflation rather price level keep very simple limit point well three though third exactly curve speak before still because publicly available source most closely relate price sumner seem discuss graphics tool federal reserve economic database fred figure graph show february march take office march note previous post decline price halt start reverse even before take office remember argue inflation didn turn positive before then deal rock bottom reverse itself free fall itself deal here graph give idea figure note february happen point during entire history calculate since there another important point quote provide above namely insist fdr’s dollar depreciation program begin october even though economic historians agree begin april exchange rate dollar begin decline against gold against other currencies quite right clear think dollar actually depreciate against gold until january sumner insistent depreciation occur before then spend time google find story jesse jones head reconstruction finance corporation soon treasury secretary morgenthau help revalue price gold economic historian sure know these days know sumner correct economic historians agree happen instead data like data scratch love data through data spare time most stuff blog instance absolutely nothing nothing opportunity play data wife usually scratch head wonder kind thing everyone need hobby watch thing learn data generally important back close original

fact data around particularly gold price easy come find examples instance table number statistical abstract unite state show supply gold unite state june each year go back annually select years before then data seem originate treasury though haven able locate contemporaneous originals footnote read part proclamation president date weight gold dollar reduce grain gold fine value gold therefore base fine ounce begin june theretofore base fine ounce other word couple months sumner other economic historians believe dollar start lose value against gold treasury report census publish statistical abstract price gold still exactly same possible census treasury make mistake go uncorrected time statistical abstract source enough especially sumner economic historians agree wrong lead document call bank monetary statistics section gold bottom paragraph leave hand column page figure dollars calculate rate fine ounce gold through january fine ounce thereafter except figure year table base upon gold price change rate result fact january dollar devalue cent term gold accordance proclamation issue president curious happen document chock full table show include other things monthly value gold holdings dollar figure involve those table also carry helpful note indicate price ounce through january ounce thereafter note value monthly holdings ounce april june july august september october november december along accord scott sumner spend years study economic historians insist price gold rise time stumble other source well look different just series show dollar price gold rise during months april january go go split baby here suggest both scott sumner economic historians right there devaluation treasury statistical abstract unite state right there wasn right very definitely good thing scott sumner economic historians say above economic historian spend formative years south american anyone spend roughly same years region could tell zimbabwean today during time turmoil last decades official exchange rate come bear relationship actual price currency trade against something consider more stable more desirable hold heck track down someone arrgentina zimbabwe european ever visit soviet block trade some western currency airport border unrealistic official exchange rate could many economic basket case likelihood transaction take place anything resemble official exchange rate similar probability someone walk chevrolet dealership msrp cash like msrp official exchange rate purpose there always someone clueless coerce enough price most part fiction either serve baseline something paper over something government want really usually print money handy excuse point point excuse doesn another guess repeat economic historian jones morgenthau pick price vein country turmoil take office there fear things worse there arm insurrection wasn time half measure guess mood white house time best summarize quote decades later immortal john candy there time think time gentlemen time think fiction change price gold accomplish nobody else believe price actually change suspect mean practice reconstruction finance corporation could more ounce gold note could borrow outside
